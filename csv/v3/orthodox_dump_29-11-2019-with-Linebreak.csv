He edited the newspapers ""Srbadija"" (1875-1877) and ""Srpska Zora"" (1876-1881) in Vienna, whose owner he was. Todor Stefanović Vilovski was a prominent figure among the Viennese Serbs. From 1875 to 1881 he was the President of the Serbian Students' Association ""Zora"". In 1879 he was named as deputy and secretary of the Serbian Church-People's Assembly in Sremski Karlovci (today Serbia). Todor Stefanović Vilovski met his future wife Camilla von Ottenfeld in the building, where both families lived (Burggasse 24, 1080 Vienna). They married in the Greek Orthodox Church of the Holy Trinity in Fleischmarkt (1010 Vienna) on 5 February 1885. His best man was the Austrian and then Serbian General Djura Horvatović (1835-1895). Since 1887 Todor Stefanović Vilovski was a corresponding member of the Anthropological Society in Vienna. In 1881 he moved from Vienna to Belgrade, where he became the editor of the newspaper ""Videlo"" and director of the Serbian Press Bureau (1881-1887 and 1912-1915). Because of political issues he returned to Vienna in 1887, where he stayed until 1895. Todor Stefanović Vilovski was director of the Serbian Post and Telegraph until 1899, when he moved again to Vienna after a conflict with the Prime Minister Vladan Djordjević (1844-1930). This time he stayed in Vienna until 1909. He lived in Belgrade from 1909 to 1915, when he was arrested after the Austro-Hungarian occupation of Serbia and sent to Vienna.  He died on 9 January 1921. In his memoirs ""Iz moga života"" he narrates important information, not only about his life in Vienna, but also about the Serbian community and the social life of the Serbs in Vienna.
Here are some examples: Vilovski's grandfather, Djordje Tamburić, was a frequent guest at Mayreder's Serbian café, located in Rotenturmstraße (1010 Vienna), until his death. He died in 1881 and was buried in the St. Marx Cemetery (1030 Vienna). As other meeting places of the Viennese Serbs Todor Stefanović Vilovski mentions the ""Mirakelkeller"" (Haarhof, Rotenturmstraße 16, 1010 Vienna) and ""Zu den drei Raben"" (Rotenturmstraße 21, 1010 Vienna). The friends and supporters of Vuk Stefanović Karadžić (1787-1864) gathered in the ""Slavonic Café"" (also ""Café Gerlovich"") of Аndrija Gerlović in Bauernmarkt (1010 Vienna) every afternoon.
Todor Stefanović Vilovski met Felix Kanitz (1829-1904) in the house of Wilhelmine-Mina Karadžić (1828-1894) in 1869. Felix Kanitz was a faithful friend of Vuk's family for the rest of his life in recognition of Vuk's support for his scholarly work in Serbia. Based on Kanitz's recommendation, Todor Stefanović Vilovski became a correspondent on the Balkans and Serbian literature in the Augsburger Allgemeine Zeitung for the duration of ten years and also one of the authors of Baron Joseph Alexander von Helfert's (1820-1910) ""Die Völker Österreich-Ungarns"" (1880). The 11th volume of this series is entitled ""Die Serben in Dalmatien und im Südlichen Ungarn, in Bosnien und im Herzegowina"" and was written by Todor Stefanović Vilovski. Vilovski's book ""Aus Belgrads Vergangenheit"" (Vienna, Druck und Verlag Adolf Holzhausen, 1894) is also of great significance, because the Emperor Franz Joseph I (1830-1916) himself in person took it for the Imperial Library (today the National Library of Austria in Vienna) and thanked the author.","4894","http://fotomuzej.com/_include/photographs/ajax-enlarge-photo.php?Url=/upload/images/stara-srpska-fotografija/velike/78-milan-jovanovic-todor-stefanovic-vilovski-1907.jpg","https://orthodoxes-wien.oeaw.ac.at/repository/pic/4894","Editorial Office of ""Srpska Zora""","""Srpska Zora"" was a Serbian illustrated journal, which was published monthly from 1876 to 1881, having a total of 44 issues.

As a church painter of the Metropolis of Sremski Karlovci (today Serbia) he came to Vienna in 1741. His works were printed by the Viennese coppersmith Thomas Meßmer. Until 1753 he was intermittently in Vienna, when he finally moved to Moscow and died in the same year. Initially, Hristofor Žefarović had come to Vienna with his nephew Georgije Žefarović (1722-1752). Georgije Žefarović was the first Serbian educated painter, but unfortunately died early. Hristofor Žefarović then adopted his sister's son Danilo Žefarović (1736-1806), who was appointed as his only successor in his testament.
He printed his most famous work entitled ""Stemmatography"" (""Stematografija"") in 1741. The role model for his publication was Pavel Ritter Vitezović's (1652-1713) heraldic book ""Stemmatography"" from the year 1702. Hristofor Žefarović translated from Latin into Church Slavonic and created several engravings and pictures, which are: the portraits of the Serbian Saints of the Middle Ages, especially the rulers and Saints of the Nemanjić Dynasty, the coats of arms of the 56 Slavic and other Balkan countries and coats of arms of different cities and states. The importance of the ""Stemmatography"" is remarkable, not only for the the Serb people, but also for all the other Southern Slavs. This book played an extremely important role in the spiritual awakening and enlightenment of the Serbs in the 18th century. It is also worth mentioning that it is dedicated to the Serbian Patriarch Arsenije IV Jovanović Šakabenta (1698-1748). In 1743 Hristofor Žefarović wrote the first translation of imperial privileges for the Serbs by the Habsburg rulers Leopold I (1640-1705), Josef I (1678-1711), Charles VI (1685-1740) and Maria Theresia (1717-1780) and printed them in Vienna.","3465","Property of the Digitalna Biblioteka Matice Srpske.

His second rule was characterised by the liberation of Serbian cities from Ottoman garrisons, which was a great diplomatic effort and success. It was also his idea to create a Balkan Federation against the Ottoman Empire. Mihailo Obrenović was an enlightened ruler who travelled through Europe during his period of exile (1844-1850). He wanted to incorporate many of the Western European achievements into Serbian society. Mihailo Obrenović died childless in 1868. He was succeeded by his cousin, Milan Obrenović (1854-1901), whose grandfather was Jevrem Obrenović (1790-1856), a brother of Prince Miloš Obrenović (1780-1860) and Prince Mihailo's uncle.
Prince Mihailo Obrenović lived in Vienna with some interruptions between 1843 and 1860. He was the friend and supporter of many Serbian poets and writers in Vienna, starting with Vuk Stefanović Karadžić (1787-1864), on whose recommendation the Prince travelled through the German states and met Leopold von Ranke (1795-1886) and Jacob Grimm (1785-1863), then Anastas Jovanović (1817-1899), Djura Daničić (1825-1882), Branko Radičević (1824-1853), etc. In July 1853 Djura Daničić returned to Vienna on the Prince's invitation to be a teacher of the Serbian language for the Princess Julie Obrenović (1831-1919).
Prince Mihailo Obrenović was also best man and godfather of the family of Major General Djordje Stratimirović (1822-1908) in Vienna. On 10 May 1854 the Prince was best man at the wedding of Djordje Stratimirović in the Greek Orthodox Church of the Holy Trinity, and then he and later the Prince and King Milan Obrenović were godfathers of the Stratimirović children. There are also several compositions of famous Austrian composers, which were dedicated to Prince Mihailo Obrenović: Johann Strauss Son op. 14 ""Serben Quadrille"" from 1846; Phillip Fahrbach Senior op. 151 ""Serben Polka"" from 1853  and Johann Dubez Op. 17 ""Divertissement sur des motifs de l'Opéra: Ernani pour la Zither"".

His painting ""Bashibozuk"" was sold at an auction at Sotheby's in London in April 2018 for £ 465,000. This was the most expensive painting of a Serbian painter to be sold worldwide. Pavle Jovanović studied at the Academy of Fine Arts in Vienna (""Akademie der bildenden Künste"") from 1877 to 1884, where he received several awards and scholarships. In 1882 he was awarded the first prize in the Academy's annual exhibition and an imperial scholarship for the painting ""Wounded Montenegrin"". The public and many art critics turned their attention to the young painter, and in 1883 he signed a contract with a gallery in London. Jovanović then travelled through the Caucasus, Morocco, Egypt, Greece, Turkey, Italy and Spain. After spending time in Paris and Munich, Pavle Jovanović stayed in Vienna, where he had his studio at Mariahilferstraße 3 (1060 Vienna). In 1899 he received the Reichel Artist Award at the Academy of Fine Arts in Vienna for his work ""Furor Teutonicus"". For the World Fair in Paris in 1900 he painted a great historical composition ""The Proclamation of Dušan's Law"", for which he received the Golden Award. Since 1905 he almost exclusively painted portraits. He has portrayed almost all famous Serbian scientists, composers and members of the Karadjordjević dynasty. Pavle Jovanović has painted more than ten portraits of Emperor Franz Joseph I (1830-1916). The Emperor's valet Eugen Ketterl describes in his memoirs that Pavle Jovanović was the best painter of the Emperor's portraits. Ketterl writes: ""Unter den Kaiserbildern ragen die von Jovanovic geschaffenen Ölgemälde durch künstlerische Vollendung und Ähnlichkeit hervor. (...) Da der Kaiser wenig Zeit zum Sitzen hatte, stellte der Künstler einmal ein Porträt in bloß zwei Stunden fertig. Es war für den Dampfer ""Franz Josef I."" der Donau-Dampfschiffahrts-Gesellschaft bestimmt, der gelegentlich der Eröffnung der Donaufahrtrinne bei Orsova eingeweiht wurde. Der Dampfer hatte einen wundervollen Speisesaal, der durch verschiebbare Wände in zwei weitere Räume - Schlafzimmer und Arbeitskabinett des Kaisers - abgeteilt werden konnte. Das Gemälde gehört zu den besten, die vom Monarchen existieren. Es stellt ihn in Kampagneuniform (blauem Waffenrock) dar und ist so sprechend ähnlich und naturgetreu, daß man vermeint, den Kaiser aus dem Rahmen heraustreten zu sehen.""

On 14 May and 24 October 1834 he sent two appeals to the Viennese police (K.K. Polizei- und Censur-Hofstelle ) in order to allow him to publish a Serbian newspaper entitled ""Narodni srbski list"" (""Serbisches Volksblatt"") on a weekly basis. On 15 January 1836 he repeated his appeal, but this time he wanted to call his newspaper ""Otečestvo"" (""Fatherland""). These newspapers should have been printed two times a week, for which the Viennese newspaper ""Wanderer"" served as a model. All these appeals were without success and the Viennese police put them ad acta on 30 June 1836 after Jović's death. Spiridon Jović was the editor and publisher of the yearly almanac ""Srbska zora"" in 1836. He prepared also a second issue, which was published by his friend Grigorije Grujić after Jović's death in 1837. In the first issue, among various other contents, Spiridon Jović published the first translation of Shakespeare in Serbian language and also his poem ""Spomen"". In the issue of 1837 was printed Grujić's obituary on Jović and two of Jović's short stories, namely ""Milutin"" and ""Nevera se sama kazni"" as well as his poem ""Pozdrav srbskim devicama"". Spiridon Jović wrote many works and pieces of literature in German language. In 1834 and 1835 he published articles for two Viennese newspapers ""Feierstunden"" and ""Der Österreichische Zuschauer"". His articles were very often of ethnographic content, but there were also a few short stories. His most valuable work was ""Ethnographisches Gemälde der slavonischen Militärgrenze"", published in Vienna in 1835. It was printed in the publishing house of the Armenian Mechitarist Monastery (Mechitaristengasse 4, 1070 Vienna) and financed by the author himself. This book contains a detailed description of the life of the Serbian population at the Habsburg Military Frontier. Some chapters were published later as newspaper articles.

The Austrian Emperor Franz Joseph I (1848-1916) permitted, at the request of the Serbian Patriarch in Sremski Karlovci Josif Rajačić (1785-1861), the constitution of the parish and the collection of donations. The constitutional meeting took place in November 1860. At this time, about 500 Serbs were living permanently and about 1,000 temporarily in Vienna. The Serbian parish received free of charge a site on the Franz-Josefs-Kai (1010 Vienna) for the erection of a new church, but the building could not start due to the lack of funds until the year 1890, which meant that a new site had to be looked for, since the old one had been already used in the meantime.
Until the year 1886 an amount of 80,000 florins (Gulden) had been collected. 80% were donated by Serbs, while 20% were given to the parish by other inhabitants of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, whose donations are recorded in the ""Golden Book of the Serbian Orthodox parish in Vienna, Names of donors and benefactors"" (Златна књига српске православне црквено-школске опћине у Бечу, Имена прилагача и добротвора). The total sum recorded in the Golden Book amounts to 25,210 florins (Gulden) and enabled the Serbian Orthodox parish to acquire a site in Veithgasse 3 (1030 Vienna) for 27,000 florins (Gulden) in 1889. The erection of the church began in 1890 under the supervision of the architect Heinrich Wagner, who himself donated 200 florins (Gulden). The erection of the building was completed in 1893 at an expense of 58,000 florins (Gulden), and the church has the capacity to hold 400 believers.
After the constitution of the Serbian Orthodox parish, there existed along with the two Greek Orthodox parishes of Saint George and the Holy Trinity all together three Orthodox parishes in Vienna, and that is why it was necessary to determine a new domain of jurisdiction. After an agreement between the three parishes, the governorship of Lower Austria (Erzherzogtum Österreich unter der Enns) decided on 1 May 1893 that the new Serbian Orthodox parish had jurisdiction over all Orthodox people of Slavic nationality.
On 19 November 1893 the church was consecrated to Saint Sava, the patron saint of all Serbs, in the presence of the Austrian Emperor Franz Joseph I, an event that was reported in several Viennese newspapers. It marked the beginning of a very fruitful period of Serbian religious and cultural life in the Austro-Hungarian capital that lasted until the outbreak of the First World War in 1914.
The first priest of the parish was Mihajlo Mišić (1864-1924) from 1896 to 1924. He was followed by Bogdan Popović (1925-1927), Dr. Rodoljub Stojaković (1927-1935) and by Dr. Miloje Aranicki (1935-1941).
In 1904 the Serbian Ladies' Benevolent Society in Vienna (""Serbischer Frauen Wohltätigkeitsverein""). was founded and had its office in the building of the Serbian Orthodox Church of St. Sava (Veithgasse 3, 1030 Vienna). Its founder and president was Jelena Ostojić (1874-1967), the daughter of Aleksandar Ostojić (1839-1917).","16.379763213487081 48.198659234714199","https://orthodoxes-wien.oeaw.ac.at/repository/pic/1235"

He was already wealthy, and his property in Vienna also grew thanks to his countrymen, who sent him all kind of goods, which Jovan Miletić sold in Vienna. About his wealth and his last will the scholar Marco Dogo writes: ""He left a fair sum to his family in his will, smaller sums to the monasteries of the Metropolis of Carlowitz (i.e. Sremski Karlovci), to the Serbian monastery on Mount Athos and to Christ's tomb in Jerusalem, a thousand florins to the Orthodox Church of Sarajevo and a further thousand florins to Sarajevo's poor people and orphans, and also 24,000 florins to the Serbian community of Trieste, the annual interest of which was to be used to pay for educating children.

He tried to create a completely new form of Serbian education in Banat. His success can be seen by the fact that there were 66 elementary schools in Banat in 1768, and 117 new ones had been opened by 1776, with the majority of them established by Teodor Janković Mirijevski. The education reform of the Serbs was only one of a series of reforms carried out in the 1770s, which had far-reaching consequences not only on the legal and political situation of the Serbs, but also on the development of their spiritual life. The reforms were implemented based on two Regulations (1770 and 1777), then the Declarations (1779) and the Consistory System (1782). One of the measures implemented was the opening of a printing press for publications printed in Cyrillic, which had a positive effect on the dissemination of respective books among the Serbs.
The reform of the Serbian primary schools was led by Stefan Vujanovski (1743-1829) in Srem, Slavonia and Croatia and Avram Mrazović (1756-1826) in Bačka. They all had first completed courses held by Johann Ignaz Melchior von Felbiger (1724-1788) for primary school principals in Vienna. Teodor Janković Mirijevski  published the first pedagogic schoolbook in Serbian language (1776).

He was a Serbian mathematician and geophysicist, who studied civil engineering at the then College of Technology (""Technische Hochschule"") in Vienna (now TU Vienna) and received his PhD there in 1904. This led to a successful, but short career as a technician. Milutin Milanković worked on major construction projects in the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Among other things, he also designed the reinforced concrete ceilings for the Karlstrakt of the main building of the Technical University in Vienna. During this time, he developed and patented new approaches to concrete construction. In 1909 Milutin Milanković left Vienna and accepted a Professorship in Applied Mathematics at the University of Belgrade. This marked a turning point in his life. In addition to dealing with engineering-technical concrete construction problems, he turned increasingly to basic astronomical-mathematical research, especially on questions of the development of the Earth's climate. He achieved great fame with the calculation of the Milanković cycles concerning the seasonal variations of solar radiation and their effects on the climate, the validity of which has long been very controversial.
Milutin Milanković contributed with three fundamental achievements to science: astronomical theories of climate change, theories of the movement of the Earth's poles and a revised Julian Calendar. Milanković's revised Julian Calendar (1923) is astronomically the most accurate calendar so far (corresponding to the date of the Gregorian Calendar), which would need correction only after the year 28,800.
After the scientific verifications of Milanković's theories and results he received international acknowledgment by the World's scientific community (also posthumous):
In 1970 on the XIV Congress of the International Astronomical Union in the Brighton one crater on the Moon (measure 34 km; coordinates + 170, +77) recieved the Milanković's name. In 1973 on the XV Congress of the International Astronomical Union in Sydney one crater on the Mars (measure 118 km, coordinates + 147, + 55) was also named after Milanković. In 1980 the Asteroid 1605 (marks 1936GA), which had been discovered by the Serbian astronomers Milorad Protić and Petar Ćurković, received Milanković's name. In 1993 the European Geosciences Union established the Milutin Milanković Medal as a prize for the acknowledgment to scientists for extraordinary research reports in the field long-term climate changes. It is awarded to scientists for their outstanding research in long-term climatic changes and modelling.
Milutin Milanković was elected a Corresponding Member of the Serbian Royal Academy (today Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts) in 1920 and a Full Member in 1924, a Corresponding Member of the Yugoslav Academy of Sciences and Arts in Zagreb in 1925 and a Member of the German Academy of Naturalists ""Leopoldine"" in Halle.

He was the founder of and professor at the High School, the forerunner of the University of Belgrade. Dositej Obradović was born in Ciacova near Timișoara in the region of Banat in the Habsburg Empire (today Romania). He became a monk in the Monastery of Novo Hopovo to the South of Novi Sad (today Serbia), received the clerical name Dositej and stayed there from 1757 to 1760. Then he abandoned his vocation and began to travel all over Europe and also Asia from 1760 to 1771, where he learned about the ideas of European Enlightenment and Rationalism. Guided by such ideas, he worked actively on the enlightening of the Serbian people, translated various works, among which the most famous are the Aesopian fables. In 1771 Dositej Obradović arrived in Vienna. In his autobiography he describes his life in Vienna from 1771 to 1777, where he was in very friendly relations with the local Serbs and Greeks. Dositej Obradović taught Ancient Greek and had in the beginning about 12 students. At the same time Dositej Obradović paid for lectures in French and Latin, but already in his third year in Vienna he also gave lectures to others in these two languages. He met all the important Serbs in Vienna, who had a remarkable influence on his social life. Among them were Atanasije Demetrović Sekereš, the Baron and General Mihailo Mikašinović (1715-1775) and his family, the Baron and General Arsenije Sečujac (1720-1814). In the house of Baron Mikašinović he gave lessons in French to Marta, the daughter of the General Sava Prodanović. Apart from the social life Dositej Obradović describes Vienna at that time and his visits to Belvedere, the Prater, Augarten and Schönbrunn. He visited the Opera, theatres and libraries. Dositej Obradović left Vienna in 1777 and after travelling all over Europe he came to Halle in Germany in 1782. Here he took off his monk's robe and started to study at the University of Halle. He attended lectures on Philosophy, Aesthetics and Theology. In this period of his life he began to write and in 1783 he published his first work entitled ""Писмо Харалампију"" (""A Letter to Haralampije"") in Leipzig. From Germany he travelled to France and from there to London, where he stayed for six months and learned English. From 1785 he lived again in Vienna and worked as a teacher. In his autobiography he describes his relations with one of the richest Serbian merchants in Vienna at that time, Maksim Kurtović (1774-1795) and his wife Jelena (1752-1808). They were very good friends, and Dositej Obradović gave to their two daughters Marija and Hristina, lessons in French and Italian. In 1789 the Austrian general Ernst Gideon Freiherr von Laudon (1717-1790) took Belgrade from the Ottoman Empire, which was celebrated by Dositej Obradović as the beginning of the liberty of the Serbian nation in his poem ""Песна о избавленију Србије"" (""Poem on the Salvation of Serbia""). He printed this poem in Vienna as well as the ""Собраније"" from 1793. Dositej Obradović stayed in Vienna until 1806, writing and printing both original works and translations.

Djura Daničić spoke Latin, German, Hungarian, Polish, Czech, Slovak and Russian, before he moved to Vienna. As Vuk's most dedicated follower he printed brochures, in which he supported Vuk's ideas. His most important text was ""The War for the Serbian Language and Orthography"" (""Рат за Српски језик и правопис"") printed in Pest in 1847. He signed this publication as Djura Daničić.

As a boy he came to Belgrade, where he engaged in drawing and engraving. Due to his significant engravings he was recommended for a scholarship abroad. Upon his arrival in Vienna in 1838, as one of ten scholarship holders, he got to know the famous Greek banker Demeter Tirka (ca. 1802-1874), who became his patron. Since Anastas Jovanović did not possess the necessary knowledge for the Academy of Fine Arts (""Akademie der bildenden Künste""), Demeter Tirka enrolled him in the Greek National School (""Griechische Nationalschule""). Demeter Tirka was the patron and godfather of Vuk Stefanović Karadzić (1787-1864) and the banker of Prince Mihailo Obrenović (1823-1868). After the Greek National School, Anastas Jovanović started his studies at the Academy of Fine Arts (""Akademie der bildenden Künste""), which was then in the Monastery of St. Anna (""Annakloster""), where he studied until 1845. Having encountered at the Academy the basics of photography, he bought a Voigtländer camera in 1840. According to him, the camera costed about 100 forints and was the third camera of its kind. Anastas Jovanović welcomed Prince Miloš Obrenović (1780-1860), when he moved to Vienna in 1841. Since then he had been in friendly relations with the Prince, first as an interpreter, and in 1844 he became his secretary. In Vienna Anastas Jovanović had his own studio, where he made icons, but he also dealt with photography and lithography, and mostly with portrait photography. He left a rich artistic and photographic legacy, which is preserved today in the Museum of the City of Belgrade (""Muzej Grada Beograda""). As a man of confidence of the Obrenović dynasty he returned with Prince Miloš Obrenović to Serbia in 1858, where he became the majordomo of Prince Mihailo Obrenović in 1860. After the Prince's death in 1868, Anastas Jovanović withdrew from public life and stayed often in Vienna, where he had been a member of the Viennese Photographic Society since 1877.

"346","Cvijić Jovan (1865-1927) ","Jovan Cvijić (1865-1927) is the best-known Serbian geologist and geographer. He was born on 12 October 1865 in Loznica (Serbia). After attending grammar school in Loznica and Šabac, he studied Natural Sciences and Mathematics at the Faculty of the High School in Belgrade from 1885 to 1888. After completing his studies, he began his systematic field trips through the Balkan Peninsula for the next 38 years. Jovan Cvijić researched more than 500,000 square kilometers of territory. In autumn 1889 he came to Vienna as a scholarship holder. He attended lectures on Physical Geography and Cartography. On 22 January 1893 he was promoted to Dr. His PhD was entitled ""Das Karstphänomen"" (""The Karst Phenomenon""). For the first time this work was printed in Vienna in the autumn of the same year. Great influence on the young Jovan Cvijić had his professors at the University of Vienna (i.e. Eduard Suess, Albrecht Penck, Julius Hann and Wilhelm Tomascheck). He often had meetings with Professor Albrecht Penck (1858-1945), where the topic of conversation was the geography of the Balkan Peninsula. His dissertation is still considered to be a fundamental work in the field of Karstology. Jovan Cvijić was the leading Karstologist of his generation, and probably the greatest Karstologist of the 19th and early 20th centuries. He has often been called the ""Father of Karst Studies"".
It is also important to say that Jovan Cvijić introduced several Serbian words to the scientific terminology, like Polje, Dolina, Uvala. From 1893 until his death in 1927 he was a Professor, first at the High School in Belgrade, and from 1905 (after the conversion of the High School in Belgrade to the University of Belgrade on 27 February 1905) full Professor of the University of Belgrade. He was also twice Rector of the University of Belgrade (1907/08 and 1919/20) and President of the Serbian Royal Academy (today Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts) from 1921 to 1927.
Jovan Cvijić was the founder of the Serbian Geographical Society (""Srpsko geografsko društvo"", 1910) and the journal of the Serbian Geographical Society (""Glasnik Srpskog geografskog društva"", 1912), which is still published today. In addition to his fundamental works on Geomorphology, Geography and Geology his anthropological and ethnographic publications are outstanding. He was the founder of the Serbian settlement research.
Jovan Cvijić played an eminent role in the Paris Peace Conference after the First World War (1919/20). He was the head of the Serbian ethnographic-historical department (in this delegation were, amongst others, the Serbian historians and former Viennese students Tihomir Djordjević, Jovan Radonić and StanojeStanojević). This department had collected scholarly, statistical and cartographic data for the negotiations.
In 1897 Jovan Cvijić published his map of Serbia and Montenegro in Vienna, which was used in the schools. The map is printed on a scale of 1: 750,000, and in the left corner one can find the map of Belgrade on a scale 1: 75,000. This map symbolises a great advancement in Serbian cartography and marked the beginning of a new era in Serbian cartography.

Jovan Cvijić was a honorary doctor of the Sorbonne University and the Charles University in Prague and a member of all major geographical societies in Europe at that time (Vienna, Paris, London, Prague, Budapest, Warsaw, Berlin etc.). He received several scientific prizes in the field of Geography. Jovan Cvijić died on 16 January 1927 in Belgrade.

In the same year he was named school principal of all Serbian primary schools in the Zagreb County. In 1792 Stefan Vujanovski was ennobled to Hungarian nobility and moved to Novi Sad (today Serbia). The education reform of the Serbs was only one of a series of reforms carried out in the 1770s, which had far-reaching consequences not only on the legal and political situation of the Serbs, but also on the development of spiritual life. The reforms were implemented through two Regulations (1770 and 1777), then the Declarations (1779) and the Consistory System (1782). One of the measures implemented was the opening of a printing press for publications printed in Cyrillic, which had a positive effect on the spreading of books among the Serbs. The reform of the Serbian primary schools was led by Teodor Janković Mirijevski (1741-1814) in Banat, by Avram Mrazović (1756-1826) in Bačka and by Stefan Vujanovski in Srem, Slavonia and Croatia.

Mihajlo Mišić was Serbian Orthodox priest in Kraljevac (today Croatia). When the Serbian Orthodox Church Community of St. Sava in Vienna had erected its Church of St. Sava (Veithgasse 3, 1030 Vienna), he applied for the position of the Community's first priest. He was one of altogether 28 candidates for this very position. Although he was chosen for this duty, he could not be appointed to this position at first due to his Hungarian citizenship. Thanks to the intervention of Bishop Nikodim Milaš (1845-1915) of Dalmatia he was finally officially appointed in 1896. Until the outbreak of the First World War (1914) Mihajlo Mišić was an integral part of the vivid religious and cultural life of the Serbian Orthodox Community. During the years of hardship in the war itself he was indefatigably supporting and helping his flock as well as Serbian prisoners of war in Austria-Hungary.

The Austrian Emperor Franz Joseph I (1848-1916) permitted, at the request of the Serbian Patriarch in Sremski Karlovci Josif Rajačić (1785-1861), the constitution of the parish and the collection of donations. The constitutional meeting took place in November 1860. At this time, about 500 Serbs were living permanently and about 1,000 temporarily in Vienna. The Serbian parish received free of charge a site on the Franz-Josefs-Kai (1010 Vienna) for the erection of a new church, but the building could not start due to the lack of funds until the year 1890, which meant that a new site had to be looked for, since the old one had been already used in the meantime.
Until the year 1886 an amount of 80,000 florins (Gulden) had been collected. 80% were donated by Serbs, while 20% were given to the parish by other inhabitants of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, whose donations are recorded in the ""Golden Book of the Serbian Orthodox parish in Vienna, Names of donors and benefactors"" (Златна књига српске православне црквено-школске опћине у Бечу, Имена прилагача и добротвора). The total sum recorded in the Golden Book amounts to 25,210 florins (Gulden) and enabled the Serbian Orthodox parish to acquire a site in Veithgasse 3 (1030 Vienna) for 27,000 florins (Gulden) in 1889. The erection of the church began in 1890 under the supervision of the architect Heinrich Wagner, who himself donated 200 florins (Gulden). The erection of the building was completed in 1893 at an expense of 58,000 florins (Gulden), and the church has the capacity to hold 400 believers.
After the constitution of the Serbian Orthodox parish, there existed along with the two Greek Orthodox parishes of Saint George and the Holy Trinity all together three Orthodox parishes in Vienna, and that is why it was necessary to determine a new domain of jurisdiction. After an agreement between the three parishes, the governorship of Lower Austria (Erzherzogtum Österreich unter der Enns) decided on 1 May 1893 that the new Serbian Orthodox parish had jurisdiction over all Orthodox people of Slavic nationality.
On 19 November 1893 the church was consecrated to Saint Sava, the patron saint of all Serbs, in the presence of the Austrian Emperor Franz Joseph I, an event that was reported in several Viennese newspapers. It marked the beginning of a very fruitful period of Serbian religious and cultural life in the Austro-Hungarian capital that lasted until the outbreak of the First World War in 1914.
The first priest of the parish was Mihajlo Mišić (1864-1924) from 1896 to 1924. He was followed by Bogdan Popović (1925-1927), Dr. Rodoljub Stojaković (1927-1935) and by Dr. Miloje Aranicki (1935-1941).
In 1904 the Serbian Ladies' Benevolent Society in Vienna (""Serbischer Frauen Wohltätigkeitsverein""). was founded and had its office in the building of the Serbian Orthodox Church of St. Sava (Veithgasse 3, 1030 Vienna).

He succeeded his cousin Prince Mihailo Obrenović (1823-1868) in 1868. During his rule Serbia became an independent state after two Serbian-Ottoman Wars (1876-1878) and was internationally recognised by the Treaty of Berlin (1878). His reign was also a period of modernisation. Milan Obrenović abdicated in 1889, and his 13 year old son Aleksandar Obrenović (1876-1903) became King. After the abdication Milan Obrenović lived in Paris and in 1897 returned to Serbia, where he was installed as the commander-in-chief of the Serbian army. After a disagreement regarding his son's wedding with Draga Mašin (1864-1903) he left Serbia. Milan Obrenović settled in Vienna. From autumn 1900 he lived firstly in the Hotel Imperial and then in an apartment in Johannesgasse 16 (1010 Vienna). Here died Milan Obrenović on 11 February 1901.

He was one of the most educated Serbs and famous benefactor, who bequeathed his entire property to the cultural and educational enlightenment of the Serbian people.
Sava Tekelija was an official, merchant, landlord and nobleman.He was the President of the “Matica Srpska” and the founder of the foundation ""Tekelijanum"" in Pest (today Hungary). He was born in Arad (today Romania) on 17 August 1761. After taking part in the Austro-Ottoman war, Sava's grandfather, Jovan Popović Tekelija, was appointed by Prince Eugene of Savoy (1663-1736) as the captain of the Serbian police (300 pistols and 200 horsemen) in 1698 and was ordered to build the fortress of Arad. In 1705 the construction of the church of St. Peter and Paul, the so-called Tekelija church, was finished. The family Tekelija remained the patron of this church until 1844, when Petar Tekelija (1784-1844), the last male descendant, died. Here is to be found the place of burial of Sava Tekelija. In 1706 Jovan Popović Tekelija was ennobled and received a coat of arms.
In the years 1779/80 Sava Tekelija wrote that his cousin from Russia came, gave him 100 rubles and took him to Vienna. For that money he bought a new suit and a golden watch. The first stay of Sava Tekelija in Vienna was from 1780 to 1782. Allegedly he came to Vienna by his parent's will, but he failed to enroll in the Military Academy. In Vienna he acquired rich knowledge. Sava Tekelija attended lectures at University (criminal, canonical, natural and general law, physics, anatomy, chemistry, botany), learned to draw and to play flute and the languages French, Italian and Spanish. From 1782 to 1786 he studied Law in Buda (today Hungary), where he received the title of Dr of Law as the first among the Serbs. In 1804 Sava Tekelija wrote to Napoleon I (1769-1821), proposing to him that he should establish a Kingdom of Illyria, which would include Serbia, Croatia, Dalmatia, Montenegro, Bosnia, Herzegovina, Boka Kotorska and Dubrovnik. In 1805 he addressed the Austrian Emperor Franz I (1768-1835) with a proposal of cooperation between Austria and Russia against Germany and France.
In August 1745 Empress Maria Theresia (1717-1780) founded the so-called ""Illyrische Hofkommission"" for the Serbian population of her realm and its administration. On 5 August 1747 it was renamed in ""Illyrische Hofdeputation"" and put under the direct control of the Habsburg ruler. The ""Illyrische Hofdeputation"" issued two Regulamenta in 1770 and 1777 and was finally dissolved in 1792. Its successor was the Hungarian Court Office. During his second stay in Vienna from 1792 to 1798 Sava Tekelija was secretary at the Hungarian Court Office. He fought for the rights of the Serbian people in Hungary, but, since he had no support in the office, decided to resign in October 1798. On this occasion he wrote in his diary about his audience to Emperor Franz I.
Since then Sava Tekelija was staying in Vienna on at least three occasions: in 1804, when he wrote the letter to Napoleon I, which he sent through the French deputy; in 1805, when he printed his map of Serbia and other countries in 2,000 copies; in 1838, when he was on his way to Bavaria for medical treatment, to take a passport. In 1838 he recorded that he saw ""steam cars on the railroad tracks, from Prater to Wagram."" After returning from the treatment, he stayed in Vienna in order to obtain a permission to establish his foundation, which became to be known as ""Tekelijanum"". In the ""Tekelijanum"" in Pest more than 350 Serbian students, among them the famous Serbian scientist Nikola Tesla (1856-1943), were accepted from 1838 to 1914 and received scholarships. In addition Sava Tekelija stated that two children of Serbian officers should be sent to the Viennese Engineering Academy and later, that more than 20 Serbian children in Vienna should be educated. For the same reason, Sava Tekelija resided again in Vienna in June 1840. In addition to the ""Tekelijanum"" he also left 100,000 forints for the Serbian students of the Engineering Academy. Four students, who were to be named by the Metropolitan of Sremski Karlovci, were to receive 4,000 forints. Jovan Subotić (1817-1886) states in his book on Sava Tekelija from 1861 that until that time 30-40 young men had already received a scholarship at the Viennese Engineering Academy.

The constitutional meeting took place in November 1860. At this time, about 500 Serbs were living permanently and about 1,000 temporarily in Vienna. The Serbian parish received free of charge a site on the Franz-Josefs-Kai (1010 Vienna) for the erection of a new church, but the building could not start due to the lack of funds until the year 1890, which meant that a new site had to be looked for, since the old one had been already used in the meantime.
Until the year 1886 an amount of 80,000 florins (Gulden) had been collected. 80% were donated by Serbs, while 20% were given to the parish by other inhabitants of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, whose donations are recorded in the ""Golden Book of the Serbian Orthodox parish in Vienna, Names of donors and benefactors"" (Златна књига српске православне црквено-школске опћине у Бечу, Имена прилагача и добротвора). The total sum recorded in the Golden Book amounts to 25,210 florins (Gulden) and enabled the Serbian Orthodox parish to acquire a site in Veithgasse 3 (1030 Vienna) for 27,000 florins (Gulden) in 1889. The erection of the church began in 1890 under the supervision of the architect Heinrich Wagner, who himself donated 200 florins (Gulden). The erection of the building was completed in 1893 at an expense of 58,000 florins (Gulden), and the church has the capacity to hold 400 believers.
After the constitution of the Serbian Orthodox parish, there existed along with the two Greek Orthodox parishes of Saint George and the Holy Trinity all together three Orthodox parishes in Vienna, and that is why it was necessary to determine a new domain of jurisdiction. After an agreement between the three parishes, the governorship of Lower Austria (Erzherzogtum Österreich unter der Enns) decided on 1 May 1893 that the new Serbian Orthodox parish had jurisdiction over all Orthodox people of Slavic nationality.
On 19 November 1893 the church was consecrated to Saint Sava, the patron saint of all Serbs, in the presence of the Austrian Emperor Franz Joseph I, an event that was reported in several Viennese newspapers. It marked the beginning of a very fruitful period of Serbian religious and cultural life in the Austro-Hungarian capital that lasted until the outbreak of the First World War in 1914.
The first priest of the parish was Mihajlo Mišić (1864-1924) from 1896 to 1924. He was followed by Bogdan Popović (1925-1927), Dr. Rodoljub Stojaković (1927-1935) and by Dr. Miloje Aranicki (1935-1941).
In 1904 the Serbian Ladies' Benevolent Society in Vienna (""Serbischer Frauen Wohltätigkeitsverein""). was founded and had its office in the building of the Serbian Orthodox Church of St. Sava (Veithgasse 3, 1030 Vienna). Its founder and president was Jelena Ostojić (1874-1967), the daughter of Aleksandar Ostojić (1839-1917).","16.379763213487081 48.198659234714199","https://orthodoxes-wien.oeaw.ac.at/repository/pic/1235"

After his education in Szeged and Pest (today Hungary), he wanted to study at the Academy of Fine Arts in Vienna (""Akademie der bildenden Künste"") and therefore moved to Vienna in 1851. Unfortunately, because of financial issues, he did not succeed. However, during one year which Djura Jakšić spent in Vienna, he visited exhibitions, museums, galleries and he painted a lot. He was the roommate of Jovan Jovanović Jovan Zmaj (1833-1904) and friend of the painters Novak Radonić and Stevan Todorović. In 1852 he returned home to Srpska Crnja (today Serbia), and soon afterwards he went to Munich and spent one year at the Academy of Fine Arts. After a few years in Kikinda (today Serbia), Djura Jakšić moved to Serbia in 1856, where he worked as a school teacher until 1872 in many cities (Belgrade, Požarevac, Kragujevac, Jagodina, etc.). From 1861 to 1862 he studied at the Academy of Fine Arts in Vienna. His benefactor in Vienna was Hariton Joanović (1824-1884), the secretary of Baron Simon von Sina (1810-1876). Joanović supported Jakšić financially and helped him to sell his paintings. As a sign of gratitude, Djura Jakšić gave him as a present his painting ""Uprising of Montenegrins"", which he painted in Vienna in 1862. The painting was in family possession until 1949, when the ""Matica Srpska"" bought it for its gallery. After his short and difficult stay in Vienna, because of new financial difficulties, Djura Jakšić continued to work as a teacher in Serbia until 1872, when he started to work in the State printing press in Belgrade, where he died in 1878.","2420","Djura Jakšić, Self-portrait (1858).

His painting ""Bashibozuk"" was sold at an auction at Sotheby's in London in April 2018 for £ 465,000. This was the most expensive painting of a Serbian painter to be sold worldwide. Pavle Jovanović studied at the Academy of Fine Arts in Vienna (""Akademie der bildenden Künste"") from 1877 to 1884, where he received several awards and scholarships. In 1882 he was awarded the first prize in the Academy's annual exhibition and an imperial scholarship for the painting ""Wounded Montenegrin"". The public and many art critics turned their attention to the young painter, and in 1883 he signed a contract with a gallery in London. Jovanović then travelled through the Caucasus, Morocco, Egypt, Greece, Turkey, Italy and Spain. After spending time in Paris and Munich, Pavle Jovanović stayed in Vienna, where he had his studio at Mariahilferstraße 3 (1060 Vienna). In 1899 he received the Reichel Artist Award at the Academy of Fine Arts in Vienna for his work ""Furor Teutonicus"". For the World Fair in Paris in 1900 he painted a great historical composition ""The Proclamation of Dušan's Law"", for which he received the Golden Award. Since 1905 he almost exclusively painted portraits. He has portrayed almost all famous Serbian scientists, composers and members of the Karadjordjević dynasty. Pavle Jovanović has painted more than ten portraits of Emperor Franz Joseph I (1830-1916). The Emperor's valet Eugen Ketterl describes in his memoirs that Pavle Jovanović was the best painter of the Emperor's portraits. Ketterl writes: ""Unter den Kaiserbildern ragen die von Jovanovic geschaffenen Ölgemälde durch künstlerische Vollendung und Ähnlichkeit hervor. (...) Da der Kaiser wenig Zeit zum Sitzen hatte, stellte der Künstler einmal ein Porträt in bloß zwei Stunden fertig. Es war für den Dampfer ""Franz Josef I."" der Donau-Dampfschiffahrts-Gesellschaft bestimmt, der gelegentlich der Eröffnung der Donaufahrtrinne bei Orsova eingeweiht wurde. Der Dampfer hatte einen wundervollen Speisesaal, der durch verschiebbare Wände in zwei weitere Räume - Schlafzimmer und Arbeitskabinett des Kaisers - abgeteilt werden konnte. Das Gemälde gehört zu den besten, die vom Monarchen existieren. Es stellt ihn in Kampagneuniform (blauem Waffenrock) dar und ist so sprechend ähnlich und naturgetreu, daß man vermeint, den Kaiser aus dem Rahmen heraustreten zu sehen.""

He was the founder of and professor at the High School, the forerunner of the University of Belgrade. Dositej Obradović was born in Ciacova near Timișoara in the region of Banat in the Habsburg Empire (today Romania). He became a monk in the Monastery of Novo Hopovo to the South of Novi Sad (today Serbia), received the clerical name Dositej and stayed there from 1757 to 1760. Then he abandoned his vocation and began to travel all over Europe and also Asia from 1760 to 1771, where he learned about the ideas of European Enlightenment and Rationalism. Guided by such ideas, he worked actively on the enlightening of the Serbian people, translated various works, among which the most famous are the Aesopian fables. In 1771 Dositej Obradović arrived in Vienna. In his autobiography he describes his life in Vienna from 1771 to 1777, where he was in very friendly relations with the local Serbs and Greeks. Dositej Obradović taught Ancient Greek and had in the beginning about 12 students. At the same time Dositej Obradović paid for lectures in French and Latin, but already in his third year in Vienna he also gave lectures to others in these two languages. He met all the important Serbs in Vienna, who had a remarkable influence on his social life. Among them were Atanasije Demetrović Sekereš, the Baron and General Mihailo Mikašinović (1715-1775) and his family, the Baron and General Arsenije Sečujac (1720-1814). In the house of Baron Mikašinović he gave lessons in French to Marta, the daughter of the General Sava Prodanović. Apart from the social life Dositej Obradović describes Vienna at that time and his visits to Belvedere, the Prater, Augarten and Schönbrunn. He visited the Opera, theatres and libraries. Dositej Obradović left Vienna in 1777 and after travelling all over Europe he came to Halle in Germany in 1782. Here he took off his monk's robe and started to study at the University of Halle. He attended lectures on Philosophy, Aesthetics and Theology. In this period of his life he began to write and in 1783 he published his first work entitled ""Писмо Харалампију"" (""A Letter to Haralampije"") in Leipzig. From Germany he travelled to France and from there to London, where he stayed for six months and learned English. From 1785 he lived again in Vienna and worked as a teacher. In his autobiography he describes his relations with one of the richest Serbian merchants in Vienna at that time, Maksim Kurtović (1774-1795) and his wife Jelena (1752-1808). They were very good friends, and Dositej Obradović gave to their two daughters Marija and Hristina, lessons in French and Italian. In 1789 the Austrian general Ernst Gideon Freiherr von Laudon (1717-1790) took Belgrade from the Ottoman Empire, which was celebrated by Dositej Obradović as the beginning of the liberty of the Serbian nation in his poem ""Песна о избавленију Србије"" (""Poem on the Salvation of Serbia""). He printed this poem in Vienna as well as the ""Собраније"" from 1793. Dositej Obradović stayed in Vienna until 1806, writing and printing both original works and translations. After the beginning of the First Serbian Uprising against the Ottoman Empire in 1804, he returned to Serbia in 1806, where he founded the High School (the forerunner of the University of Belgrade) and was the first Minister of Education in the first Serbian government. He died on 28 March 1811 in Belgrade, where he was buried.","2393","Lithograph by Anastas Jovanović, Vienna 1852.

The Austrian Emperor Franz Joseph I (1848-1916) permitted, at the request of the Serbian Patriarch in Sremski Karlovci Josif Rajačić (1785-1861), the constitution of the parish and the collection of donations. The constitutional meeting took place in November 1860. At this time, about 500 Serbs were living permanently and about 1,000 temporarily in Vienna. The Serbian parish received free of charge a site on the Franz-Josefs-Kai (1010 Vienna) for the erection of a new church, but the building could not start due to the lack of funds until the year 1890, which meant that a new site had to be looked for, since the old one had been already used in the meantime.
Until the year 1886 an amount of 80,000 florins (Gulden) had been collected. 80% were donated by Serbs, while 20% were given to the parish by other inhabitants of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, whose donations are recorded in the ""Golden Book of the Serbian Orthodox parish in Vienna, Names of donors and benefactors"" (Златна књига српске православне црквено-школске опћине у Бечу, Имена прилагача и добротвора). The total sum recorded in the Golden Book amounts to 25,210 florins (Gulden) and enabled the Serbian Orthodox parish to acquire a site in Veithgasse 3 (1030 Vienna) for 27,000 florins (Gulden) in 1889. The erection of the church began in 1890 under the supervision of the architect Heinrich Wagner, who himself donated 200 florins (Gulden). The erection of the building was completed in 1893 at an expense of 58,000 florins (Gulden), and the church has the capacity to hold 400 believers.
After the constitution of the Serbian Orthodox parish, there existed along with the two Greek Orthodox parishes of Saint George and the Holy Trinity all together three Orthodox parishes in Vienna, and that is why it was necessary to determine a new domain of jurisdiction. After an agreement between the three parishes, the governorship of Lower Austria (Erzherzogtum Österreich unter der Enns) decided on 1 May 1893 that the new Serbian Orthodox parish had jurisdiction over all Orthodox people of Slavic nationality.
On 19 November 1893 the church was consecrated to Saint Sava, the patron saint of all Serbs, in the presence of the Austrian Emperor Franz Joseph I, an event that was reported in several Viennese newspapers. It marked the beginning of a very fruitful period of Serbian religious and cultural life in the Austro-Hungarian capital that lasted until the outbreak of the First World War in 1914.
The first priest of the parish was Mihajlo Mišić (1864-1924) from 1896 to 1924. He was followed by Bogdan Popović (1925-1927), Dr. Rodoljub Stojaković (1927-1935) and by Dr. Miloje Aranicki (1935-1941).

He became also well known for his collection of Serbian folk songs, fairy tailes and riddles. Vuk Stefanović Karadžić lived and worked in Vienna for more than 50 years. He moved there in 1813 after the end of the First Serbian Uprising (1804-1813) against the Ottoman Empire. In Vienna Vuk Stefanović Karadžić met Jernej Kopitar (1780-1844), a Slovenian philologist and censor at the Imperial Library, who encouraged Vuk in his collection of folk material. Vuk met Dimitrije Davidović, Dimitrije Frušić and Sava Mrkalj in Pest and stayed in contact with them also in Vienna. Vuk printed his first book entitled ""Pesnarica"" (a collection of Serbian folk songs) in Vienna in the Schnierer publishing house in 1,500 copies. In the same year Vuk printed the book ""Pismenica""  (""Pismenica serbskoga jezika""), the first grammar of the reformed Serbian language. Vuk published a new edition in 1818, which was translated by the famous German philologist Jacob Grimm (1785-1863) into the German language in 1824 (entitled ""Kleine serbische Grammatik""). Grimm was impressed by the Serbian cultural heritage in the form of folk poems and songs. Vuk met Jacob Grimm in 1823 and Johann Wolfgang von Goethe (1749-1832) in his house in Weimar in 1824. Goethe was interested in Serbian folk poetry since the year 1778, when he translated ""Hasanaginica"", a South Slavic folk ballad. From 1823 to 1827 Goethe translated folk songs from Vuk's books in the journal ""Über Kunst und Alterthum"", the first one was ""Dioba Jakšića"" (""Erbschaftsteilung""). Apart from Goethe and Grimm Vuk's folk songs were translated into Czech (""Prostonárodní srbská muza, do Cech převedená"", 1817), English (""Servian popular poetry"", 1827), Swedish (""Serbiska folksänger"", 1830), Hungarian (""Szerb népdalok hősregék"", 1836) and into Polish (""Narodowe piesni serbskie"", 1853). Kopitar introduced Vuk to Leopold von Ranke (1795-1886), one of the greatest German historians, in 1827. On the basis of Vuk's knowledge of the First Serbian Uprising against the Ottoman Empire, Ranke published his book on the ""Serbian revolution"" in 1828.
Vuk's Serbian-German Dictionary, printed in 1818 in the publishing house of the Armenian Mechitarist Monastery (Mechitaristengasse 4, 1070 Vienna), was the first book ever printed in the newly reformed Serbian language. Vuk standardised the Serbian Cyrillic alphabet based on the phonemic principle of Johann Christoph Adellung (1732-1806), a great German philologist. His motto was: ""Write as you speak, and read as it is written"". This book was printed from donations, firstly by Theodor Demeter Tirka (1764-1839), a Greek merchant and banker from Vienna, who was also godfather of Vuk's children.
Vuk married Anna Kraus (1788-1876) in the Roman Catholic Church of St. Rochus (Landstraßer Hauptstraße 54-56, 1030 Vienna) on 28 January 1818. His best man was Jernej Kopitar. Vuk's first rented apartment was that of Anna's father, where they met. During his life in Vienna Vuk changed address more than 20 times. The couple had 12 children, but only two of them overlived Vuk: his daughter Wilhelmine-Mina (1828-1894) and his son Dimitrije (1836-1883).
Vuk was very active in the social life among the Viennese Serbs. He was a friend of Prince Miloš Obrenović and Prince Mihailo Obrenović, Petar Petrović Njegoš, Djura Daničić, Branko Radičević, Anastas Jovanović, etc. Vuk was also very reputable among all Slavs, his friends and associates were the Russian priest Michail Fjodorowitsch Rajewski (1811-1844), Jernej Kopitar, Josef Dobrovský (1753-1829), František Palacký (1798-1876), Pavel Jozef Šafárik (1795-1861), Franz Xaver Ritter von Miklosich (1813-1891), etc. Vuk was often guest in the so-called ""Slavonic Café"" (also ""Café Gerlovich""), also ""Zum Weissen Wolfen"" (Fleischmarkt 20/Wolfengasse 3, 1010 Vienna), and other places where the Slavs gathered in Vienna.
In 1823 Vuk became honorary Doctor of Philosophy at the University of Jena. In 1826 Vuk received a Russian and in 1835 a Serbian pension. He was very reputable in the Russian Empire. Apart from the pension the Russian Emperor Nikolaj I Pavlovič (1796-1855) honored him with the Gold medal in 1841 and in 1862 he was awarded with the Order of St. Anna 2nd class with crown. Vuk became a corresponding member of the Imperial Academy of Sciences in Vienna on 14 January 1848. Three days before he had received a ring with brilliants as a gift of the Austrian Emperor Ferdinand I (1793-1875), who thanked him for his book of Serbian folk songs entitled ""Srpske Narodne pjesme"". In 1850 the Austrian Emperor Franz Joseph I (1830-1916) honored Vuk with the Knight's Cross of the Franz Josef Order 3rd class and in 1851 with the Gold Medal for Science. Vuk was also awarded the Prussian Order of the Red Eagle 3rd class in 1852.

As a boy he came to Belgrade, where he engaged in drawing and engraving. Due to his significant engravings he was recommended for a scholarship abroad. Upon his arrival in Vienna in 1838, as one of ten scholarship holders, he got to know the famous Greek banker Demeter Tirka (ca. 1802-1874), who became his patron. Since Anastas Jovanović did not possess the necessary knowledge for the Academy of Fine Arts (""Akademie der bildenden Künste""), Demeter Tirka enrolled him in the Greek National School (""Griechische Nationalschule""). Demeter Tirka was the patron and godfather of Vuk Stefanović Karadzić (1787-1864) and the banker of Prince Mihailo Obrenović (1823-1868). After the Greek National School, Anastas Jovanović started his studies at the Academy of Fine Arts (""Akademie der bildenden Künste""), which was then in the Monastery of St. Anna (""Annakloster""), where he studied until 1845. Having encountered at the Academy the basics of photography, he bought a Voigtländer camera in 1840. According to him, the camera costed about 100 forints and was the third camera of its kind. Anastas Jovanović welcomed Prince Miloš Obrenović (1780-1860), when he moved to Vienna in 1841. Since then he had been in friendly relations with the Prince, first as an interpreter, and in 1844 he became his secretary. In Vienna Anastas Jovanović had his own studio, where he made icons, but he also dealt with photography and lithography, and mostly with portrait photography. He left a rich artistic and photographic legacy, which is preserved today in the Museum of the City of Belgrade (""Muzej Grada Beograda""). As a man of confidence of the Obrenović dynasty he returned with Prince Miloš Obrenović to Serbia in 1858, where he became the majordomo of Prince Mihailo Obrenović in 1860. After the Prince's death in 1868, Anastas Jovanović withdrew from public life and stayed often in Vienna, where he had been a member of the Viennese Photographic Society since 1877.

On 14 May and 24 October 1834 he sent two appeals to the Viennese police (K.K. Polizei- und Censur-Hofstelle ) in order to allow him to publish a Serbian newspaper entitled ""Narodni srbski list"" (""Serbisches Volksblatt"") on a weekly basis. On 15 January 1836 he repeated his appeal, but this time he wanted to call his newspaper ""Otečestvo"" (""Fatherland""). These newspapers should have been printed two times a week, for which the Viennese newspaper ""Wanderer"" served as a model. All these appeals were without success and the Viennese police put them ad acta on 30 June 1836 after Jović's death. Spiridon Jović was the editor and publisher of the yearly almanac ""Srbska zora"" in 1836. He prepared also a second issue, which was published by his friend Grigorije Grujić after Jović's death in 1837. In the first issue, among various other contents, Spiridon Jović published the first translation of Shakespeare in Serbian language and also his poem ""Spomen"". In the issue of 1837 was printed Grujić's obituary on Jović and two of Jović's short stories, namely ""Milutin"" and ""Nevera se sama kazni"" as well as his poem ""Pozdrav srbskim devicama"". Spiridon Jović wrote many works and pieces of literature in German language. In 1834 and 1835 he published articles for two Viennese newspapers ""Feierstunden"" and ""Der Österreichische Zuschauer"". His articles were very often of ethnographic content, but there were also a few short stories. His most valuable work was ""Ethnographisches Gemälde der slavonischen Militärgrenze"", published in Vienna in 1835. It was printed in the publishing house of the Armenian Mechitarist Monastery (Mechitaristengasse 4, 1070 Vienna) and financed by the author himself. This book contains a detailed description of the life of the Serbian population at the Habsburg Military Frontier. Some chapters were published later as newspaper articles. The book was dedicated to Carl Ritter von Pidoll zu Quintenbach, who was Hofrat and was serving as official at the Military Frontier.

His second rule was characterised by the liberation of Serbian cities from Ottoman garrisons, which was a great diplomatic effort and success. It was also his idea to create a Balkan Federation against the Ottoman Empire. Mihailo Obrenović was an enlightened ruler who travelled through Europe during his period of exile (1844-1850). He wanted to incorporate many of the Western European achievements into Serbian society. Mihailo Obrenović died childless in 1868.

Prince Mihailo Obrenović lived in Vienna with some interruptions between 1843 and 1860.

There are several compositions of Austrian composers, which were dedicated to King Milan Obrenović: two compositions to King Milan and Queen Natalija by Philipp Fahrbach Junior (1884), the ""King Milan March"" by Anton Riedl (1885) and three songs by Carl Streitmann (1887).","143","https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Exk%C3%B6nig_Milan_(Wiener_Bilder_1901).png","https://orthodoxes-wien.oeaw.ac.at/repository/pic/143","Serbian Orthodox Church of Saint Sava in Veithgasse ","Around the middle of the 19th century the Viennese Serbs set about founding their church parish of Saint Sava under the leadership of Privy Councillor Dr. Georgije Stojaković (1811-1863). The Austrian Emperor Franz Joseph I (1848-1916) permitted, at the request of the Serbian Patriarch in Sremski Karlovci Josif Rajačić (1785-1861), the constitution of the parish and the collection of donations. The constitutional meeting took place in November 1860. At this time, about 500 Serbs were living permanently and about 1,000 temporarily in Vienna. The Serbian parish received free of charge a site on the Franz-Josefs-Kai (1010 Vienna) for the erection of a new church, but the building could not start due to the lack of funds until the year 1890, which meant that a new site had to be looked for, since the old one had been already used in the meantime.
Until the year 1886 an amount of 80,000 florins (Gulden) had been collected. 80% were donated by Serbs, while 20% were given to the parish by other inhabitants of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, whose donations are recorded in the ""Golden Book of the Serbian Orthodox parish in Vienna, Names of donors and benefactors"" (Златна књига српске православне црквено-школске опћине у Бечу, Имена прилагача и добротвора). The total sum recorded in the Golden Book amounts to 25,210 florins (Gulden) and enabled the Serbian Orthodox parish to acquire a site in Veithgasse 3 (1030 Vienna) for 27,000 florins (Gulden) in 1889. The erection of the church began in 1890 under the supervision of the architect Heinrich Wagner, who himself donated 200 florins (Gulden). The erection of the building was completed in 1893 at an expense of 58,000 florins (Gulden), and the church has the capacity to hold 400 believers.
After the constitution of the Serbian Orthodox parish, there existed along with the two Greek Orthodox parishes of Saint George and the Holy Trinity all together three Orthodox parishes in Vienna, and that is why it was necessary to determine a new domain of jurisdiction. After an agreement between the three parishes, the governorship of Lower Austria (Erzherzogtum Österreich unter der Enns) decided on 1 May 1893 that the new Serbian Orthodox parish had jurisdiction over all Orthodox people of Slavic nationality.
On 19 November 1893 the church was consecrated to Saint Sava, the patron saint of all Serbs, in the presence of the Austrian Emperor Franz Joseph I, an event that was reported in several Viennese newspapers. It marked the beginning of a very fruitful period of Serbian religious and cultural life in the Austro-Hungarian capital that lasted until the outbreak of the First World War in 1914.
The first priest of the parish was Mihajlo Mišić (1864-1924) from 1896 to 1924. He was followed by Bogdan Popović (1925-1927), Dr. Rodoljub Stojaković (1927-1935) and by Dr. Miloje Aranicki (1935-1941).
In 1904 the Serbian Ladies' Benevolent Society in Vienna (""Serbischer Frauen Wohltätigkeitsverein""). was founded and had its office in the building of the Serbian Orthodox Church of St. Sava (Veithgasse 3, 1030 Vienna). Its founder and president was Jelena Ostojić (1874-1967), the daughter of Aleksandar Ostojić (1839-1917).","16.379763213487081 48.198659234714199","https://orthodoxes-wien.oeaw.ac.at/repository/pic/1235"

He was the founder of and professor at the High School, the forerunner of the University of Belgrade. Dositej Obradović was born in Ciacova near Timișoara in the region of Banat in the Habsburg Empire (today Romania). He became a monk in the Monastery of Novo Hopovo to the South of Novi Sad (today Serbia), received the clerical name Dositej and stayed there from 1757 to 1760. Then he abandoned his vocation and began to travel all over Europe and also Asia from 1760 to 1771, where he learned about the ideas of European Enlightenment and Rationalism. Guided by such ideas, he worked actively on the enlightening of the Serbian people, translated various works, among which the most famous are the Aesopian fables. In 1771 Dositej Obradović arrived in Vienna. In his autobiography he describes his life in Vienna from 1771 to 1777, where he was in very friendly relations with the local Serbs and Greeks.

At the same time Dositej Obradović paid for lectures in French and Latin, but already in his third year in Vienna he also gave lectures to others in these two languages. He met all the important Serbs in Vienna, who had a remarkable influence on his social life. Among them were Atanasije Demetrović Sekereš, the Baron and General Mihailo Mikašinović (1715-1775) and his family, the Baron and General Arsenije Sečujac (1720-1814).

Dositej Obradović left Vienna in 1777 and after travelling all over Europe he came to Halle in Germany in 1782. Here he took off his monk's robe and started to study at the University of Halle. He attended lectures on Philosophy, Aesthetics and Theology. In this period of his life he began to write and in 1783 he published his first work entitled ""Писмо Харалампију"" (""A Letter to Haralampije"") in Leipzig. From Germany he travelled to France and from there to London, where he stayed for six months and learned English. From 1785 he lived again in Vienna and worked as a teacher.

He printed this poem in Vienna as well as the ""Собраније"" from 1793. Dositej Obradović stayed in Vienna until 1806, writing and printing both original works and translations.

One of the measures implemented was the opening of a printing press for publications printed in Cyrillic, which had a positive effect on the spreading of books among the Serbs. The reform of the Serbian primary schools was led by Teodor Janković Mirijevski (1741-1814) in Banat, by Avram Mrazović (1756-1826) in Bačka and by Stefan Vujanovski in Srem, Slavonia and Croatia. They all had first completed courses held by Felbiger for primary school principals in Vienna. Stefan Vujanovski published a German grammar entitled ""Немецкаја Граматика"" in 1772 at the printing house of Josef von Kurzböck (1736-1792), a philological study entitled ""Руководство ко правоглаголанију и правописанију"" and a short history of the Church for the schools entitled ""Кратка историја цркве"", both in 1793, at the printing house of Stefan von Novaković in Vienna.","3480","Property of the Digitalna Biblioteka Matice Srpske.

"1089","Tekelija Popović  Sava (1761-1842)","Sava Popović Tekelija von Kevermes (1761-1842) was the symbol of the Serbian bourgeoisie in the Austrian Empire. He was one of the most educated Serbs and famous benefactor, who bequeathed his entire property to the cultural and educational enlightenment of the Serbian people.
Sava Tekelija was an official, merchant, landlord and nobleman.He was the President of the “Matica Srpska” and the founder of the foundation ""Tekelijanum"" in Pest (today Hungary). He was born in Arad (today Romania) on 17 August 1761. After taking part in the Austro-Ottoman war, Sava's grandfather, Jovan Popović Tekelija, was appointed by Prince Eugene of Savoy (1663-1736) as the captain of the Serbian police (300 pistols and 200 horsemen) in 1698 and was ordered to build the fortress of Arad. In 1705 the construction of the church of St. Peter and Paul, the so-called Tekelija church, was finished. The family Tekelija remained the patron of this church until 1844, when Petar Tekelija (1784-1844), the last male descendant, died. Here is to be found the place of burial of Sava Tekelija. In 1706 Jovan Popović Tekelija was ennobled and received a coat of arms.
In the years 1779/80 Sava Tekelija wrote that his cousin from Russia came, gave him 100 rubles and took him to Vienna. For that money he bought a new suit and a golden watch. The first stay of Sava Tekelija in Vienna was from 1780 to 1782. Allegedly he came to Vienna by his parent's will, but he failed to enroll in the Military Academy. In Vienna he acquired rich knowledge. Sava Tekelija attended lectures at University (criminal, canonical, natural and general law, physics, anatomy, chemistry, botany), learned to draw and to play flute and the languages French, Italian and Spanish. From 1782 to 1786 he studied Law in Buda (today Hungary), where he received the title of Dr of Law as the first among the Serbs. In 1804 Sava Tekelija wrote to Napoleon I (1769-1821), proposing to him that he should establish a Kingdom of Illyria, which would include Serbia, Croatia, Dalmatia, Montenegro, Bosnia, Herzegovina, Boka Kotorska and Dubrovnik. In 1805 he addressed the Austrian Emperor Franz I (1768-1835) with a proposal of cooperation between Austria and Russia against Germany and France.
In August 1745 Empress Maria Theresia (1717-1780) founded the so-called ""Illyrische Hofkommission"" for the Serbian population of her realm and its administration. On 5 August 1747 it was renamed in ""Illyrische Hofdeputation"" and put under the direct control of the Habsburg ruler. The ""Illyrische Hofdeputation"" issued two Regulamenta in 1770 and 1777 and was finally dissolved in 1792. Its successor was the Hungarian Court Office. During his second stay in Vienna from 1792 to 1798 Sava Tekelija was secretary at the Hungarian Court Office. He fought for the rights of the Serbian people in Hungary, but, since he had no support in the office, decided to resign in October 1798. On this occasion he wrote in his diary about his audience to Emperor Franz I.
Since then Sava Tekelija was staying in Vienna on at least three occasions: in 1804, when he wrote the letter to Napoleon I, which he sent through the French deputy; in 1805, when he printed his map of Serbia and other countries in 2,000 copies; in 1838, when he was on his way to Bavaria for medical treatment, to take a passport. In 1838 he recorded that he saw ""steam cars on the railroad tracks, from Prater to Wagram."" After returning from the treatment, he stayed in Vienna in order to obtain a permission to establish his foundation, which became to be known as ""Tekelijanum"". In the ""Tekelijanum"" in Pest more than 350 Serbian students, among them the famous Serbian scientist Nikola Tesla (1856-1943), were accepted from 1838 to 1914 and received scholarships. In addition Sava Tekelija stated that two children of Serbian officers should be sent to the Viennese Engineering Academy and later, that more than 20 Serbian children in Vienna should be educated. For the same reason, Sava Tekelija resided again in Vienna in June 1840. In addition to the ""Tekelijanum"" he also left 100,000 forints for the Serbian students of the Engineering Academy. Four students, who were to be named by the Metropolitan of Sremski Karlovci, were to receive 4,000 forints. Jovan Subotić (1817-1886) states in his book on Sava Tekelija from 1861 that until that time 30-40 young men had already received a scholarship at the Viennese Engineering Academy.

After attending grammar school in Loznica and Šabac, he studied Natural Sciences and Mathematics at the Faculty of the High School in Belgrade from 1885 to 1888. After completing his studies, he began his systematic field trips through the Balkan Peninsula for the next 38 years. Jovan Cvijić researched more than 500,000 square kilometers of territory. In autumn 1889 he came to Vienna as a scholarship holder. He attended lectures on Physical Geography and Cartography. On 22 January 1893 he was promoted to Dr. His PhD was entitled ""Das Karstphänomen"" (""The Karst Phenomenon""). For the first time this work was printed in Vienna in the autumn of the same year. Great influence on the young Jovan Cvijić had his professors at the University of Vienna (i.e. Eduard Suess, Albrecht Penck, Julius Hann and Wilhelm Tomascheck). He often had meetings with Professor Albrecht Penck (1858-1945), where the topic of conversation was the geography of the Balkan Peninsula. His dissertation is still considered to be a fundamental work in the field of Karstology. Jovan Cvijić was the leading Karstologist of his generation, and probably the greatest Karstologist of the 19th and early 20th centuries. He has often been called the ""Father of Karst Studies"".
It is also important to say that Jovan Cvijić introduced several Serbian words to the scientific terminology, like Polje, Dolina, Uvala. From 1893 until his death in 1927 he was a Professor, first at the High School in Belgrade, and from 1905 (after the conversion of the High School in Belgrade to the University of Belgrade on 27 February 1905) full Professor of the University of Belgrade. He was also twice Rector of the University of Belgrade (1907/08 and 1919/20) and President of the Serbian Royal Academy (today Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts) from 1921 to 1927.
Jovan Cvijić was the founder of the Serbian Geographical Society (""Srpsko geografsko društvo"", 1910) and the journal of the Serbian Geographical Society (""Glasnik Srpskog geografskog društva"", 1912), which is still published today. In addition to his fundamental works on Geomorphology, Geography and Geology his anthropological and ethnographic publications are outstanding. He was the founder of the Serbian settlement research.
Jovan Cvijić played an eminent role in the Paris Peace Conference after the First World War (1919/20). He was the head of the Serbian ethnographic-historical department (in this delegation were, amongst others, the Serbian historians and former Viennese students Tihomir Djordjević, Jovan Radonić and StanojeStanojević). This department had collected scholarly, statistical and cartographic data for the negotiations.
In 1897 Jovan Cvijić published his map of Serbia and Montenegro in Vienna, which was used in the schools. The map is printed on a scale of 1: 750,000, and in the left corner one can find the map of Belgrade on a scale 1: 75,000. This map symbolises a great advancement in Serbian cartography and marked the beginning of a new era in Serbian cartography.

Jovan Cvijić was a honorary doctor of the Sorbonne University and the Charles University in Prague and a member of all major geographical societies in Europe at that time (Vienna, Paris, London, Prague, Budapest, Warsaw, Berlin etc.). He received several scientific prizes in the field of Geography. Jovan Cvijić died on 16 January 1927 in Belgrade.

He was a Serbian mathematician and geophysicist, who studied civil engineering at the then College of Technology (""Technische Hochschule"") in Vienna (now TU Vienna) and received his PhD there in 1904. This led to a successful, but short career as a technician. Milutin Milanković worked on major construction projects in the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Among other things, he also designed the reinforced concrete ceilings for the Karlstrakt of the main building of the Technical University in Vienna. During this time, he developed and patented new approaches to concrete construction. In 1909 Milutin Milanković left Vienna and accepted a Professorship in Applied Mathematics at the University of Belgrade. This marked a turning point in his life. In addition to dealing with engineering-technical concrete construction problems, he turned increasingly to basic astronomical-mathematical research, especially on questions of the development of the Earth's climate. He achieved great fame with the calculation of the Milanković cycles concerning the seasonal variations of solar radiation and their effects on the climate, the validity of which has long been very controversial.
Milutin Milanković contributed with three fundamental achievements to science: astronomical theories of climate change, theories of the movement of the Earth's poles and a revised Julian Calendar. Milanković's revised Julian Calendar (1923) is astronomically the most accurate calendar so far (corresponding to the date of the Gregorian Calendar), which would need correction only after the year 28,800.
After the scientific verifications of Milanković's theories and results he received international acknowledgment by the World's scientific community (also posthumous):
In 1970 on the XIV Congress of the International Astronomical Union in the Brighton one crater on the Moon (measure 34 km; coordinates + 170, +77) recieved the Milanković's name. In 1973 on the XV Congress of the International Astronomical Union in Sydney one crater on the Mars (measure 118 km, coordinates + 147, + 55) was also named after Milanković. In 1980 the Asteroid 1605 (marks 1936GA), which had been discovered by the Serbian astronomers Milorad Protić and Petar Ćurković, received Milanković's name. In 1993 the European Geosciences Union established the Milutin Milanković Medal as a prize for the acknowledgment to scientists for extraordinary research reports in the field long-term climate changes. It is awarded to scientists for their outstanding research in long-term climatic changes and modelling.
Milutin Milanković was elected a Corresponding Member of the Serbian Royal Academy (today Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts) in 1920 and a Full Member in 1924, a Corresponding Member of the Yugoslav Academy of Sciences and Arts in Zagreb in 1925 and a Member of the German Academy of Naturalists ""Leopoldine"" in Halle.

The Confraternity obtained, with the support of the famous Austrian General Prince Eugene of Savoy (1663-1736), an imperial privilege by the Emperor Karl VI of Habsburg (1685-1740) in 1723, which allowed the foundation of the first Orthodox chapel in Vienna. It was dedicated to St. George and was first located in the Dempfingerhof (Seitenstettengasse 4, 1010 Vienna) and then in the Steyrerhof (Griechengasse 3, 1010 Vienna). The Confraternity received imperial privileges by the Empress Maria Theresia (1717-1780) and the Emperors Joseph II (1741-1790), Leopold II (1747-1792) and Franz II (1768-1835).

In the same year the headstone for a Church of St. George was laid and it was built by the architect Franz Wipplinger (1760-1812) until 1806 at a cost of 126,784 florins. It was renovated through the generosity of the Greek banker and industrialist Nikolaos Dumba (1830-1900) in the year 1898. A belfry was erected by the architect Ludwig Tischler (1840-1906). After more than 100 years His Eminence Metropolitan Arsenios of Austria accomplished an extensive renovation of the church in the years 2015/2016.

She was born in Vienna on 20 May 1874. Jelena Ostojić was the founder and president of the Serbian Ladies' Benevolent Society in Vienna (""Serbischer Frauen Wohltätigkeitsverein""). This society was founded in 1904 and dissolved on 1 November 1914. Its office was to be found in the building of the Serbian Orthodox Church of St. Sava (Veithgasse 3, 1030 Vienna).

The Austrian Emperor Franz Joseph I (1848-1916) permitted, at the request of the Serbian Patriarch in Sremski Karlovci Josif Rajačić (1785-1861), the constitution of the parish and the collection of donations. The constitutional meeting took place in November 1860. At this time, about 500 Serbs were living permanently and about 1,000 temporarily in Vienna. The Serbian parish received free of charge a site on the Franz-Josefs-Kai (1010 Vienna) for the erection of a new church, but the building could not start due to the lack of funds until the year 1890, which meant that a new site had to be looked for, since the old one had been already used in the meantime.
Until the year 1886 an amount of 80,000 florins (Gulden) had been collected. 80% were donated by Serbs, while 20% were given to the parish by other inhabitants of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, whose donations are recorded in the ""Golden Book of the Serbian Orthodox parish in Vienna, Names of donors and benefactors"" (Златна књига српске православне црквено-школске опћине у Бечу, Имена прилагача и добротвора). The total sum recorded in the Golden Book amounts to 25,210 florins (Gulden) and enabled the Serbian Orthodox parish to acquire a site in Veithgasse 3 (1030 Vienna) for 27,000 florins (Gulden) in 1889. The erection of the church began in 1890 under the supervision of the architect Heinrich Wagner, who himself donated 200 florins (Gulden). The erection of the building was completed in 1893 at an expense of 58,000 florins (Gulden), and the church has the capacity to hold 400 believers.
After the constitution of the Serbian Orthodox parish, there existed along with the two Greek Orthodox parishes of Saint George and the Holy Trinity all together three Orthodox parishes in Vienna, and that is why it was necessary to determine a new domain of jurisdiction. After an agreement between the three parishes, the governorship of Lower Austria (Erzherzogtum Österreich unter der Enns) decided on 1 May 1893 that the new Serbian Orthodox parish had jurisdiction over all Orthodox people of Slavic nationality.
On 19 November 1893 the church was consecrated to Saint Sava, the patron saint of all Serbs, in the presence of the Austrian Emperor Franz Joseph I, an event that was reported in several Viennese newspapers.

As a church painter of the Metropolis of Sremski Karlovci (today Serbia) he came to Vienna in 1741. His works were printed by the Viennese coppersmith Thomas Meßmer. Until 1753 he was intermittently in Vienna, when he finally moved to Moscow and died in the same year. Initially, Hristofor Žefarović had come to Vienna with his nephew Georgije Žefarović (1722-1752). Georgije Žefarović was the first Serbian educated painter, but unfortunately died early. Hristofor Žefarović then adopted his sister's son Danilo Žefarović (1736-1806), who was appointed as his only successor in his testament.
He printed his most famous work entitled ""Stemmatography"" (""Stematografija"") in 1741. The role model for his publication was Pavel Ritter Vitezović's (1652-1713) heraldic book ""Stemmatography"" from the year 1702. Hristofor Žefarović translated from Latin into Church Slavonic and created several engravings and pictures, which are: the portraits of the Serbian Saints of the Middle Ages, especially the rulers and Saints of the Nemanjić Dynasty, the coats of arms of the 56 Slavic and other Balkan countries and coats of arms of different cities and states. The importance of the ""Stemmatography"" is remarkable, not only for the the Serb people, but also for all the other Southern Slavs. This book played an extremely important role in the spiritual awakening and enlightenment of the Serbs in the 18th century. It is also worth mentioning that it is dedicated to the Serbian Patriarch Arsenije IV Jovanović Šakabenta (1698-1748). In 1743 Hristofor Žefarović wrote the first translation of imperial privileges for the Serbs by the Habsburg rulers Leopold I (1640-1705), Josef I (1678-1711), Charles VI (1685-1740) and Maria Theresia (1717-1780) and printed them in Vienna.","3465","Property of the Digitalna Biblioteka Matice Srpske.

He immigrated to the United States of America in 1884 and sold the patent rights to his system of alternating-current dynamos, transformers, and motors to George Westinghouse (1846-1914). In 1891 he invented the Tesla coil, an induction coil widely used in radio technology. George Westinghouse used Tesla's alternating current system to light the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago in 1893. This success was a factor in their winning the contract to install the first power machinery at Niagara Falls, which bore Tesla's name and patent numbers. The project carried power to Buffalo by 1896. Nikola Tesla died in New York on Orthodox Christmas, 7 January 1943.

He edited the newspapers ""Srbadija"" (1875-1877) and ""Srpska Zora"" (1876-1881) in Vienna, whose owner he was. Todor Stefanović Vilovski was a prominent figure among the Viennese Serbs. From 1875 to 1881 he was the President of the Serbian Students' Association ""Zora"". In 1879 he was named as deputy and secretary of the Serbian Church-People's Assembly in Sremski Karlovci (today Serbia). Todor Stefanović Vilovski met his future wife Camilla von Ottenfeld in the building, where both families lived (Burggasse 24, 1080 Vienna). They married in the Greek Orthodox Church of the Holy Trinity in Fleischmarkt (1010 Vienna) on 5 February 1885. His best man was the Austrian and then Serbian General Djura Horvatović (1835-1895). Since 1887 Todor Stefanović Vilovski was a corresponding member of the Anthropological Society in Vienna. In 1881 he moved from Vienna to Belgrade, where he became the editor of the newspaper ""Videlo"" and director of the Serbian Press Bureau (1881-1887 and 1912-1915). Because of political issues he returned to Vienna in 1887, where he stayed until 1895. Todor Stefanović Vilovski was director of the Serbian Post and Telegraph until 1899, when he moved again to Vienna after a conflict with the Prime Minister Vladan Djordjević (1844-1930). This time he stayed in Vienna until 1909. He lived in Belgrade from 1909 to 1915, when he was arrested after the Austro-Hungarian occupation of Serbia and sent to Vienna.  He died on 9 January 1921. In his memoirs ""Iz moga života"" he narrates important information, not only about his life in Vienna, but also about the Serbian community and the social life of the Serbs in Vienna.
Here are some examples: Vilovski's grandfather, Djordje Tamburić, was a frequent guest at Mayreder's Serbian café, located in Rotenturmstraße (1010 Vienna), until his death. He died in 1881 and was buried in the St. Marx Cemetery (1030 Vienna). As other meeting places of the Viennese Serbs Todor Stefanović Vilovski mentions the ""Mirakelkeller"" (Haarhof, Rotenturmstraße 16, 1010 Vienna) and ""Zu den drei Raben"" (Rotenturmstraße 21, 1010 Vienna). The friends and supporters of Vuk Stefanović Karadžić (1787-1864) gathered in the ""Slavonic Café"" (also ""Café Gerlovich"") of Аndrija Gerlović in Bauernmarkt (1010 Vienna) every afternoon.
Todor Stefanović Vilovski met Felix Kanitz (1829-1904) in the house of Wilhelmine-Mina Karadžić (1828-1894) in 1869. Felix Kanitz was a faithful friend of Vuk's family for the rest of his life in recognition of Vuk's support for his scholarly work in Serbia.

In 1881 he moved from Vienna to Belgrade, where he became the editor of the newspaper ""Videlo"" and director of the Serbian Press Bureau (1881-1887 and 1912-1915). Because of political issues he returned to Vienna in 1887, where he stayed until 1895. Todor Stefanović Vilovski was director of the Serbian Post and Telegraph until 1899, when he moved again to Vienna after a conflict with the Prime Minister Vladan Djordjević (1844-1930). This time he stayed in Vienna until 1909. He lived in Belgrade from 1909 to 1915, when he was arrested after the Austro-Hungarian occupation of Serbia and sent to Vienna.  He died on 9 January 1921. In his memoirs ""Iz moga života"" he narrates important information, not only about his life in Vienna, but also about the Serbian community and the social life of the Serbs in Vienna.
Here are some examples: Vilovski's grandfather, Djordje Tamburić, was a frequent guest at Mayreder's Serbian café, located in Rotenturmstraße (1010 Vienna), until his death. He died in 1881 and was buried in the St. Marx Cemetery (1030 Vienna). As other meeting places of the Viennese Serbs Todor Stefanović Vilovski mentions the ""Mirakelkeller"" (Haarhof, Rotenturmstraße 16, 1010 Vienna) and ""Zu den drei Raben"" (Rotenturmstraße 21, 1010 Vienna). The friends and supporters of Vuk Stefanović Karadžić (1787-1864) gathered in the ""Slavonic Café"" (also ""Café Gerlovich"") of Аndrija Gerlović in Bauernmarkt (1010 Vienna) every afternoon.
Todor Stefanović Vilovski met Felix Kanitz (1829-1904) in the house of Wilhelmine-Mina Karadžić (1828-1894) in 1869. Felix Kanitz was a faithful friend of Vuk's family for the rest of his life in recognition of Vuk's support for his scholarly work in Serbia. Based on Kanitz's recommendation, Todor Stefanović Vilovski became a correspondent on the Balkans and Serbian literature in the Augsburger Allgemeine Zeitung for the duration of ten years and also one of the authors of Baron Joseph Alexander von Helfert's (1820-1910) ""Die Völker Österreich-Ungarns"" (1880). The 11th volume of this series is entitled ""Die Serben in Dalmatien und im Südlichen Ungarn, in Bosnien und im Herzegowina"" and was written by Todor Stefanović Vilovski. Vilovski's book ""Aus Belgrads Vergangenheit"" (Vienna, Druck und Verlag Adolf Holzhausen, 1894) is also of great significance, because the Emperor Franz Joseph I (1830-1916) himself in person took it for the Imperial Library (today the National Library of Austria in Vienna) and thanked the author.","4894","http://fotomuzej.com/_include/photographs/ajax-enlarge-photo.php?Url=/upload/images/stara-srpska-fotografija/velike/78-milan-jovanovic-todor-stefanovic-vilovski-1907.jpg","https://orthodoxes-wien.oeaw.ac.at/repository/pic/4894","Editorial Office of ""Srpska Zora""","""Srpska Zora"" was a Serbian illustrated journal, which was published monthly from 1876 to 1881, having a total of 44 issues.

Vuk published a new edition in 1818, which was translated by the famous German philologist Jacob Grimm (1785-1863) into the German language in 1824 (entitled ""Kleine serbische Grammatik""). Grimm was impressed by the Serbian cultural heritage in the form of folk poems and songs. Vuk met Jacob Grimm in 1823 and Johann Wolfgang von Goethe (1749-1832) in his house in Weimar in 1824. Goethe was interested in Serbian folk poetry since the year 1778, when he translated ""Hasanaginica"", a South Slavic folk ballad. From 1823 to 1827 Goethe translated folk songs from Vuk's books in the journal ""Über Kunst und Alterthum"", the first one was ""Dioba Jakšića"" (""Erbschaftsteilung"").

His motto was: ""Write as you speak, and read as it is written"". This book was printed from donations, firstly by Theodor Demeter Tirka (1764-1839), a Greek merchant and banker from Vienna, who was also godfather of Vuk's children.

From 1823 to 1827 Goethe translated folk songs from Vuk's books in the journal ""Über Kunst und Alterthum"", the first one was ""Dioba Jakšića"" (""Erbschaftsteilung""). Apart from Goethe and Grimm Vuk's folk songs were translated into Czech (""Prostonárodní srbská muza, do Cech převedená"", 1817), English (""Servian popular poetry"", 1827), Swedish (""Serbiska folksänger"", 1830), Hungarian (""Szerb népdalok hősregék"", 1836) and into Polish (""Narodowe piesni serbskie"", 1853). Kopitar introduced Vuk to Leopold von Ranke (1795-1886), one of the greatest German historians, in 1827. On the basis of Vuk's knowledge of the First Serbian Uprising against the Ottoman Empire, Ranke published his book on the ""Serbian revolution"" in 1828.
Vuk's Serbian-German Dictionary, printed in 1818 in the publishing house of the Armenian Mechitarist Monastery (Mechitaristengasse 4, 1070 Vienna), was the first book ever printed in the newly reformed Serbian language. Vuk standardised the Serbian Cyrillic alphabet based on the phonemic principle of Johann Christoph Adellung (1732-1806), a great German philologist. His motto was: ""Write as you speak, and read as it is written"". This book was printed from donations, firstly by Theodor Demeter Tirka (1764-1839), a Greek merchant and banker from Vienna, who was also godfather of Vuk's children.
Vuk married Anna Kraus (1788-1876) in the Roman Catholic Church of St. Rochus (Landstraßer Hauptstraße 54-56, 1030 Vienna) on 28 January 1818. His best man was Jernej Kopitar. Vuk's first rented apartment was that of Anna's father, where they met. During his life in Vienna Vuk changed address more than 20 times. The couple had 12 children, but only two of them overlived Vuk: his daughter Wilhelmine-Mina (1828-1894) and his son Dimitrije (1836-1883).
Vuk was very active in the social life among the Viennese Serbs. He was a friend of Prince Miloš Obrenović and Prince Mihailo Obrenović, Petar Petrović Njegoš, Djura Daničić, Branko Radičević, Anastas Jovanović, etc. Vuk was also very reputable among all Slavs, his friends and associates were the Russian priest Michail Fjodorowitsch Rajewski (1811-1844), Jernej Kopitar, Josef Dobrovský (1753-1829), František Palacký (1798-1876), Pavel Jozef Šafárik (1795-1861), Franz Xaver Ritter von Miklosich (1813-1891), etc. Vuk was often guest in the so-called ""Slavonic Café"" (also ""Café Gerlovich""), also ""Zum Weissen Wolfen"" (Fleischmarkt 20/Wolfengasse 3, 1010 Vienna), and other places where the Slavs gathered in Vienna.
In 1823 Vuk became honorary Doctor of Philosophy at the University of Jena. In 1826 Vuk received a Russian and in 1835 a Serbian pension. He was very reputable in the Russian Empire. Apart from the pension the Russian Emperor Nikolaj I Pavlovič (1796-1855) honored him with the Gold medal in 1841 and in 1862 he was awarded with the Order of St. Anna 2nd class with crown. Vuk became a corresponding member of the Imperial Academy of Sciences in Vienna on 14 January 1848. Three days before he had received a ring with brilliants as a gift of the Austrian Emperor Ferdinand I (1793-1875), who thanked him for his book of Serbian folk songs entitled ""Srpske Narodne pjesme"". In 1850 the Austrian Emperor Franz Joseph I (1830-1916) honored Vuk with the Knight's Cross of the Franz Josef Order 3rd class and in 1851 with the Gold Medal for Science. Vuk was also awarded the Prussian Order of the Red Eagle 3rd class in 1852.

He was Prince of Serbia from 1838 to 1842, and after his exile from 1860 to his assassination on 10 June 1868 in Belgrade. His second rule was characterised by the liberation of Serbian cities from Ottoman garrisons, which was a great diplomatic effort and success. It was also his idea to create a Balkan Federation against the Ottoman Empire. Mihailo Obrenović was an enlightened ruler who travelled through Europe during his period of exile (1844-1850). He wanted to incorporate many of the Western European achievements into Serbian society. Mihailo Obrenović died childless in 1868. He was succeeded by his cousin, Milan Obrenović (1854-1901), whose grandfather was Jevrem Obrenović (1790-1856), a brother of Prince Miloš Obrenović (1780-1860) and Prince Mihailo's uncle.

Jovan Rajić collected sources in the Russian Empire and on the Holy Mount Athos. He also used parts of the manuscript of Count Djordje Branković (1645-1711). Apart from its scholarly character, Jovan Rajić's ""History"" was the first Serbian book, which was printed by subscription.

"1148","Karadžić Stefanović Vuk (1787-1864)","Vuk Stefanović Karadžić (1787-1864) was a Serbian philologist and linguist and greatest reformer of the Serbian language. He became also well known for his collection of Serbian folk songs, fairy tailes and riddles. Vuk Stefanović Karadžić lived and worked in Vienna for more than 50 years. He moved there in 1813 after the end of the First Serbian Uprising (1804-1813) against the Ottoman Empire. In Vienna Vuk Stefanović Karadžić met Jernej Kopitar (1780-1844), a Slovenian philologist and censor at the Imperial Library, who encouraged Vuk in his collection of folk material. Vuk met Dimitrije Davidović, Dimitrije Frušić and Sava Mrkalj in Pest and stayed in contact with them also in Vienna. Vuk printed his first book entitled ""Pesnarica"" (a collection of Serbian folk songs) in Vienna in the Schnierer publishing house in 1,500 copies. In the same year Vuk printed the book ""Pismenica""  (""Pismenica serbskoga jezika""), the first grammar of the reformed Serbian language. Vuk published a new edition in 1818, which was translated by the famous German philologist Jacob Grimm (1785-1863) into the German language in 1824 (entitled ""Kleine serbische Grammatik""). Grimm was impressed by the Serbian cultural heritage in the form of folk poems and songs. Vuk met Jacob Grimm in 1823 and Johann Wolfgang von Goethe (1749-1832) in his house in Weimar in 1824. Goethe was interested in Serbian folk poetry since the year 1778, when he translated ""Hasanaginica"", a South Slavic folk ballad. From 1823 to 1827 Goethe translated folk songs from Vuk's books in the journal ""Über Kunst und Alterthum"", the first one was ""Dioba Jakšića"" (""Erbschaftsteilung""). Apart from Goethe and Grimm Vuk's folk songs were translated into Czech (""Prostonárodní srbská muza, do Cech převedená"", 1817), English (""Servian popular poetry"", 1827), Swedish (""Serbiska folksänger"", 1830), Hungarian (""Szerb népdalok hősregék"", 1836) and into Polish (""Narodowe piesni serbskie"", 1853). Kopitar introduced Vuk to Leopold von Ranke (1795-1886), one of the greatest German historians, in 1827. On the basis of Vuk's knowledge of the First Serbian Uprising against the Ottoman Empire, Ranke published his book on the ""Serbian revolution"" in 1828.
Vuk's Serbian-German Dictionary, printed in 1818 in the publishing house of the Armenian Mechitarist Monastery (Mechitaristengasse 4, 1070 Vienna), was the first book ever printed in the newly reformed Serbian language. Vuk standardised the Serbian Cyrillic alphabet based on the phonemic principle of Johann Christoph Adellung (1732-1806), a great German philologist. His motto was: ""Write as you speak, and read as it is written"". This book was printed from donations, firstly by Theodor Demeter Tirka (1764-1839), a Greek merchant and banker from Vienna, who was also godfather of Vuk's children.
Vuk married Anna Kraus (1788-1876) in the Roman Catholic Church of St. Rochus (Landstraßer Hauptstraße 54-56, 1030 Vienna) on 28 January 1818. His best man was Jernej Kopitar. Vuk's first rented apartment was that of Anna's father, where they met. During his life in Vienna Vuk changed address more than 20 times. The couple had 12 children, but only two of them overlived Vuk: his daughter Wilhelmine-Mina (1828-1894) and his son Dimitrije (1836-1883).
Vuk was very active in the social life among the Viennese Serbs. He was a friend of Prince Miloš Obrenović and Prince Mihailo Obrenović, Petar Petrović Njegoš, Djura Daničić, Branko Radičević, Anastas Jovanović, etc. Vuk was also very reputable among all Slavs, his friends and associates were the Russian priest Michail Fjodorowitsch Rajewski (1811-1844), Jernej Kopitar, Josef Dobrovský (1753-1829), František Palacký (1798-1876), Pavel Jozef Šafárik (1795-1861), Franz Xaver Ritter von Miklosich (1813-1891), etc. Vuk was often guest in the so-called ""Slavonic Café"" (also ""Café Gerlovich""), also ""Zum Weissen Wolfen"" (Fleischmarkt 20/Wolfengasse 3, 1010 Vienna), and other places where the Slavs gathered in Vienna.
In 1823 Vuk became honorary Doctor of Philosophy at the University of Jena. In 1826 Vuk received a Russian and in 1835 a Serbian pension. He was very reputable in the Russian Empire. Apart from the pension the Russian Emperor Nikolaj I Pavlovič (1796-1855) honored him with the Gold medal in 1841 and in 1862 he was awarded with the Order of St. Anna 2nd class with crown. Vuk became a corresponding member of the Imperial Academy of Sciences in Vienna on 14 January 1848. Three days before he had received a ring with brilliants as a gift of the Austrian Emperor Ferdinand I (1793-1875), who thanked him for his book of Serbian folk songs entitled ""Srpske Narodne pjesme"". In 1850 the Austrian Emperor Franz Joseph I (1830-1916) honored Vuk with the Knight's Cross of the Franz Josef Order 3rd class and in 1851 with the Gold Medal for Science. Vuk was also awarded the Prussian Order of the Red Eagle 3rd class in 1852.
Vuk died in his appartment, where he spent his last 15 years of life, in Marokkanergasse 3 (1030 Vienna) on 7 February 1864. After the memorial service in the Greek Orthodox Church of St. George in Griechengasse 5 (1010 Vienna) he was buried in the Orthodox part of the St. Marx Cemetery (1030 Vienna). His mortal remains were transferred to Belgrade in 1897, while the tombstone still stands in the Orthodox part of the St. Marx Cemetery. On the house in Marokkanergasse 3 (1030 Vienna) a memorial plaque was placed in the 1950s, and Vuk’s monument was erected in Rasumofskygasse 22 (1030 Vienna) in 1987.","3457","https://sr.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%92%D1%83%D0%BA_%D0%A1%D1%82%D0%B5%D1%84%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B8%D1%9B_%D0%9A%D0%B0%D1%80%D0%B0%D1%9F%D0%B8%D1%9B#/media/File:%D0%92%D1%83%D0%BA_%D0%A1%D1%82%D0%B5%D1%84%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B8%D1%9B_%D0%9A%D0%B0%D1%80%D0%B0%D1%9F%D0%B8%D1%9B.1846.jpg","https://orthodoxes-wien.oeaw.ac.at/repository/pic/3457","Theater in der Josefstadt (Sträußelsäle)","The first Slavic Ball took place in the Theater in der Josefstadt (Sträußelsäle) in Vienna on 4 February 1844.

He was Prince of Serbia from 1838 to 1842, and after his exile from 1860 to his assassination on 10 June 1868 in Belgrade. His second rule was characterised by the liberation of Serbian cities from Ottoman garrisons, which was a great diplomatic effort and success. It was also his idea to create a Balkan Federation against the Ottoman Empire. Mihailo Obrenović was an enlightened ruler who travelled through Europe during his period of exile (1844-1850). He wanted to incorporate many of the Western European achievements into Serbian society. Mihailo Obrenović died childless in 1868. He was succeeded by his cousin, Milan Obrenović (1854-1901), whose grandfather was Jevrem Obrenović (1790-1856), a brother of Prince Miloš Obrenović (1780-1860) and Prince Mihailo's uncle.
Prince Mihailo Obrenović lived in Vienna with some interruptions between 1843 and 1860. He was the friend and supporter of many Serbian poets and writers in Vienna, starting with Vuk Stefanović Karadžić (1787-1864), on whose recommendation the Prince travelled through the German states and met Leopold von Ranke (1795-1886) and Jacob Grimm (1785-1863), then Anastas Jovanović (1817-1899), Djura Daničić (1825-1882), Branko Radičević (1824-1853), etc. In July 1853 Djura Daničić returned to Vienna on the Prince's invitation to be a teacher of the Serbian language for the Princess Julie Obrenović (1831-1919).
Prince Mihailo Obrenović was also best man and godfather of the family of Major General Djordje Stratimirović (1822-1908) in Vienna. On 10 May 1854 the Prince was best man at the wedding of Djordje Stratimirović in the Greek Orthodox Church of the Holy Trinity, and then he and later the Prince and King Milan Obrenović were godfathers of the Stratimirović children. There are also several compositions of famous Austrian composers, which were dedicated to Prince Mihailo Obrenović: Johann Strauss Son op. 14 ""Serben Quadrille"" from 1846; Phillip Fahrbach Senior op. 151 ""Serben Polka"" from 1853  and Johann Dubez Op. 17 ""Divertissement sur des motifs de l'Opéra: Ernani pour la Zither"". He married Countess Julie Hunyady de Kéthely (1831-1919) in the Russian Orthodox chapel of the Russian Legation in Vienna on 1 August 1853. His best man was the Russian diplomat Peter von Meyendorff (1796-1863). The Austrian newspapers wrote that the Prince was dressed in national costume and had a sabre with diamonds worth 80,000 florins. On the other side the Princess wore a diamond diadem. They lived in the ""Obrenovic-Palais"" in Vienna and the Castle of ""Ivanka"" near Bratislava (Ivanka pri Dunaji, today Slovakia). They separated by a signed agreement on 18 November 1865. The house in Vienna (estimated to be worth 100,000 ducats) and also the Castle of ""Ivanka"" became a property of the Princess and she received a yearly allocation of 5,500 ducats.","636","https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Knez_Mihajlo_III_Obrenovic.jpg","https://orthodoxes-wien.oeaw.ac.at/repository/pic/636","Theater in der Josefstadt (Sträußelsäle)","The first Slavic Ball took place in the Theater in der Josefstadt (Sträußelsäle) in Vienna on 4 February 1844.

He became also well known for his collection of Serbian folk songs, fairy tailes and riddles. Vuk Stefanović Karadžić lived and worked in Vienna for more than 50 years. He moved there in 1813 after the end of the First Serbian Uprising (1804-1813) against the Ottoman Empire. In Vienna Vuk Stefanović Karadžić met Jernej Kopitar (1780-1844), a Slovenian philologist and censor at the Imperial Library, who encouraged Vuk in his collection of folk material. Vuk met Dimitrije Davidović, Dimitrije Frušić and Sava Mrkalj in Pest and stayed in contact with them also in Vienna. Vuk printed his first book entitled ""Pesnarica"" (a collection of Serbian folk songs) in Vienna in the Schnierer publishing house in 1,500 copies. In the same year Vuk printed the book ""Pismenica""  (""Pismenica serbskoga jezika""), the first grammar of the reformed Serbian language. Vuk published a new edition in 1818, which was translated by the famous German philologist Jacob Grimm (1785-1863) into the German language in 1824 (entitled ""Kleine serbische Grammatik""). Grimm was impressed by the Serbian cultural heritage in the form of folk poems and songs. Vuk met Jacob Grimm in 1823 and Johann Wolfgang von Goethe (1749-1832) in his house in Weimar in 1824. Goethe was interested in Serbian folk poetry since the year 1778, when he translated ""Hasanaginica"", a South Slavic folk ballad. From 1823 to 1827 Goethe translated folk songs from Vuk's books in the journal ""Über Kunst und Alterthum"", the first one was ""Dioba Jakšića"" (""Erbschaftsteilung""). Apart from Goethe and Grimm Vuk's folk songs were translated into Czech (""Prostonárodní srbská muza, do Cech převedená"", 1817), English (""Servian popular poetry"", 1827), Swedish (""Serbiska folksänger"", 1830), Hungarian (""Szerb népdalok hősregék"", 1836) and into Polish (""Narodowe piesni serbskie"", 1853). Kopitar introduced Vuk to Leopold von Ranke (1795-1886), one of the greatest German historians, in 1827. On the basis of Vuk's knowledge of the First Serbian Uprising against the Ottoman Empire, Ranke published his book on the ""Serbian revolution"" in 1828.
Vuk's Serbian-German Dictionary, printed in 1818 in the publishing house of the Armenian Mechitarist Monastery (Mechitaristengasse 4, 1070 Vienna), was the first book ever printed in the newly reformed Serbian language. Vuk standardised the Serbian Cyrillic alphabet based on the phonemic principle of Johann Christoph Adellung (1732-1806), a great German philologist. His motto was: ""Write as you speak, and read as it is written"". This book was printed from donations, firstly by Theodor Demeter Tirka (1764-1839), a Greek merchant and banker from Vienna, who was also godfather of Vuk's children.
Vuk married Anna Kraus (1788-1876) in the Roman Catholic Church of St. Rochus (Landstraßer Hauptstraße 54-56, 1030 Vienna) on 28 January 1818. His best man was Jernej Kopitar. Vuk's first rented apartment was that of Anna's father, where they met. During his life in Vienna Vuk changed address more than 20 times. The couple had 12 children, but only two of them overlived Vuk: his daughter Wilhelmine-Mina (1828-1894) and his son Dimitrije (1836-1883).
Vuk was very active in the social life among the Viennese Serbs. He was a friend of Prince Miloš Obrenović and Prince Mihailo Obrenović, Petar Petrović Njegoš, Djura Daničić, Branko Radičević, Anastas Jovanović, etc. Vuk was also very reputable among all Slavs, his friends and associates were the Russian priest Michail Fjodorowitsch Rajewski (1811-1844), Jernej Kopitar, Josef Dobrovský (1753-1829), František Palacký (1798-1876), Pavel Jozef Šafárik (1795-1861), Franz Xaver Ritter von Miklosich (1813-1891), etc. Vuk was often guest in the so-called ""Slavonic Café"" (also ""Café Gerlovich""), also ""Zum Weissen Wolfen"" (Fleischmarkt 20/Wolfengasse 3, 1010 Vienna), and other places where the Slavs gathered in Vienna.
In 1823 Vuk became honorary Doctor of Philosophy at the University of Jena. In 1826 Vuk received a Russian and in 1835 a Serbian pension. He was very reputable in the Russian Empire. Apart from the pension the Russian Emperor Nikolaj I Pavlovič (1796-1855) honored him with the Gold medal in 1841 and in 1862 he was awarded with the Order of St. Anna 2nd class with crown. Vuk became a corresponding member of the Imperial Academy of Sciences in Vienna on 14 January 1848. Three days before he had received a ring with brilliants as a gift of the Austrian Emperor Ferdinand I (1793-1875), who thanked him for his book of Serbian folk songs entitled ""Srpske Narodne pjesme"".
